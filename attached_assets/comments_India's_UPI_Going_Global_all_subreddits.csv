"This kreo thing is like indian startup 101 (there are still good startups) but it is the most basic one. Find a market where there in no Indian brand, get funding through daddy's contact, import chinese stuff and sell it with indian branding, waste money foolishly on influencers, make false claims and projections, run out of money, close the startup and repeat from step 1. 

The thing that baffles me most is how do they even acquire funding for such stupid ideas.

Edit: apparently they got 6.5 cr for the first round funding and they projected to get upto 40-50 cr in revenue by the end of their first year. These vc firms can't be serious.",IndianGaming

Waiting for Kreo to make a post explaining their BS marketing.",IndianGaming
"Here is TLDR; (I used CHATGPT)

The Reddit post exposes Kreo for allegedly using ChatGPT to write fake reviews on their product pages, paying YouTubers for scripted positive reviews, and lying about their business practices. The user provides numerous screenshots and detailed examples to support their claims. They highlight instances of fake reviews for chairs, keyboards, and other products, noting repetitive use of specific props in review photos that tie back to Kreo’s office. The post also accuses Kreo of grouping different products on Amazon to inflate review counts and hiding negative reviews.

The user claims Kreo's CEO lies about product costs and business practices, stating that Kreo uses OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) products from China but falsely claims exclusivity. They allege Kreo avoids honoring warranty claims to maintain revenue and makes false commitments about product features. The post aims to warn potential customers, especially younger and more impressionable ones, about Kreo's unethical practices and urges the community to scrutinize the company's actions more closely.",IndianGaming
"Getting chinese OEMs and promoting them as ""Made in India"". Yeah, that's enough to tell that the company is a scam.",IndianGaming
"This was a pretty good read. Thanks for taking the time and making such an in-depth exposé on these scumbags. I had hopes for them, thought they were genuine but seems it was all a facade. I will not consider Kreo products anymore even if I am on a tight budget. Again thanks for bringing awareness to this bro.",IndianGaming
"Thanks dude, I already had a thought that there is something off  with this company. While searching for RK and AULA Keyboard, Kreo used to pop up in between. All positive reviews, no complaints, sugar coated YT reviews etc.

"Alot of Indian streamers were using their products so I thought they were trying to become the elgato of india
Then i saw mouse and keyboards, controllers 
And recently during their sale where I saw they also have chairs on their websites LMAO it was obvious what they were doing
There are lot of Tech brands who did the same, made their share ,now put a factory for assembly so they can put made in India label over it.

Influencers/youtubers promoting kreo and using their products also gave them huge boost but are youtubers at fault if their product were good,? 

This is a great post but unless this reaches instagram and youtube or medium which people browse before buying it will be forgotten in a while

But then I came across some videos of the CEO on YouTube in which he appealed to us that this is an Indian brand worth supporting and they have a far greater vision of serving the Indian gaming community
The appeal in the videos made me change my mind I though I'll be buying from then this Diwali sale but when I looked at the products I instantly realized that all these are OEM Chinese products with just branding and no soul, no rnd, no designing.
As a competitive fps gamer playing only Val and CS throughout the year, I really need well designing high performing products like of logitech/razer and Kreo just wasn't gonna cut it.

Also I'm a fan of hardware mana and I was really surprised seeing him associate himself with a company like Kreo, but then I thought he doesn't get as many views as he deserves and if he's getting money out of this, good for him.

I know all these brand, buy there product from china there was no doubt but RR and lying in social media to gain sympathy cheap tactics.

At least other brand like cosmic byte don't do RR, let me know if I am wrong.

Also posting fake review is not good. if you believe product is good then it will get good reviews. However ,In india many people tend to give 4 star even if the product is perfect.  so maybe they try fake review to overcome such reviews

"About a month ago there was a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mkindia/comments/1fgpy1n/psa_kreos_horrible_aftersales_service/) on r/mkindia about Kreo's bad after-sales service. If you scroll to the very bottom of the comments, there is a now-deleted comment from an employee of Kreo where they were getting defensive/harassing the person that made the post. 

There's an [update post](https://old.reddit.com/r/mkindia/comments/1fngq7c/update_on_the_kreo_situation/) where thankfully that person's issue was resolved, and the CEO is in the comments claiming that the person who made the fake account has been suspended (not fired?).

I saw all the fake reviews. Hence I discarded them from the list.,IndianGaming
"Hey - I’m Ishan, Founder u/Kreo - here to openly address the recent concerns raised about us. The post includes some serious misunderstandings, and I want to clarify each of the allegations made point-by-point. We are happy to have an open, live dialogue on each of these issues as well.
While we’re committed to transparency, it’s disheartening to see a team member share internal information externally, an act that is both illegal and unethical.
1. Reviews
Website Reviews: A few initial reviews for every product come from friends and existing/repeat/power users to help build visibility during product launches. This is standard and provides a boost in early-stage feedback—many brands do this. Some automated reviews provided to such buyers were sloppy and slipped through wrt those ""chatgpt"" type responses; we’ve removed those and also are removing the remaining few. We also encourage buyers to leave reviews, giving them some assistance with images if they agree (the photos that you see), again these were clearly sloppy from us and we will change this even more going forward.
Amazon Reviews: Amazon’s guidelines let brands group variants to gain traction during launch, which helps smaller brands like us stay competitive against products with 1000+ reviews. We separate them later once reviews stabilize. Gaming Amazon reviews is risky due to its strict algorithms, which detect fake activity. As a young brand, we avoid these risks that could lead to severe account penalties.
2. Youtube Reviews 
– We collaborate with creators genuinely interested in testing our products. While most reviews are barter-based, some creators ask for payments unfortunately (a norm in India’s low CPC market). Unlike brands that fully script reviews, we do NOT influence reviewers and often work with creators who may give us critical feedback also. Again, this is a standard industry practice as it’s one of the best ways to get word-of-mouth going. 
– Also, Sunny (aka Hardware Mana) not covering Kreo on his YT  was a conscious decision that we made because it would be a heavy conflict of interest if he came in and reviewed our products (the ones he’s making himself) on his own channel along with other companies. 
3. Working with OEM 
– Yes, we work with OEMs, as do most players in the electronics industry. Major brands like Apple and Logitech rely on OEMs, especially for scaling. Creating a fully in-house supply chain requires substantial capital and teams, often achievable only for companies over $100M in scale. Even giants such as Boat, Noise, Mamaearth, in the BPC and electronics category haven’t been able to build this sort of muscle.
– Kreo products are exclusive to India and unique in design. A lot of work has gone into uniquely designing each Kreo product, and I can cover these points of differentiation in a separate post. 
4. Costs
– The “leaked” costs were actually internal target costs, not actual figures.
– The cost that has been leaked for Swarm of $18 FOB is our TARGET cost and not actual, which we never achieved. 
– The ACTUAL purchase cost of ~3400 is broken down to COGS (including FOB cost) + All forms of freight and pre-last mile warehousing (freight costs come to $55+ per CBM currently) + Leakages + Servicing interest + damages, which actually comes to the price we quoted. 
– In terms of Amazon commissions, you’re only referring to the referral fee of 15% with your screenshot, this does not include closing fee, pick and package, FBA warehousing, FBA last mile etc – these collectively amount to 20%+. You can view these here as well: https://sellercentral.amazon.in/fba/profitabilitycalculator/index?lang=en_IN
– Also, being VC funded doesn’t provide us ANY commissions rebates. Maybe if we provide a huge amount of business, they MIGHT consider giving some rebates in the future (even this wont be more than 1-2%), however, we are very VERY small for Amazon.
5. Fake info 
Any misinformation on our pages was unintentional, and we’ve since refined our listings and product pages. For example, in terms of hotswap vs. hotplug, we clearly mentioned to every one early on itself that we don’t recommend modding / hotswapping Hive as the experience was sub-par, and even the influencers covered this bit. In fact, in the latest version of Hive we’ve actually improved this considerably and I’m open to sending you a review unit as well.
6. Response to Recent Warranty Concerns:
Yes, our warranty responses lagged initially due to a surge in orders. We weren’t fully set up for such a high volume, but we’ve since made real improvements to reduce response times. We’ve worked hard to fix the bottlenecks, and our turnaround times (TATs) are now significantly better. Even major players (like Flipkart, Amazon, or Nykaa) face the same issues. If a delay or miss happens, it’s not intentional, and we always aim to resolve it quickly and effectively.
7. R&D 
Each product goes through months of market research and sampling before launch, with around 20-40 prototypes tested before finalizing a model. Building a more intensive R&D process requires substantial funding, which we’re actively working on. Developing proprietary tech is our future goal, as demonstrated by larger brands like Nothing who are further along with extensive capital ($100M+ of theirs vs us at $1.1M and only a year of existence).
8. Bringing costs down
We aim to reduce costs by increasing India-based production, which requires upfront investment. Currently, we’re in discussions with Indian manufacturers/assemblers and exploring options to localize production further. This will involve setting up supply chains, similar to companies like Ultrahuman, to reduce reliance on imports. Labor and chipset costs in India are favorable, but certain components are still sourced globally.
We genuinely regret any frustration any practice may have caused and are taking immediate steps to refine them. That said, I want to assure you—there is nothing fraudulent here. We are a team of passionate individuals, putting in countless hours and making personal sacrifices to build something truly meaningful. Our dream is to bring an honest, high-quality Indian brand to the world. Please see this for what it is: a dedicated effort by a hardworking team, not the baseless allegations of one unhappy former/current employee.   
At the end of the day, it’s about the products. Try them out, I’m here to hear your genuine thoughts on them",IndianGaming
"Honestly, if they were honest about the product i legit would’ve gotten their products.

Been using ironcat mice for a while, they’re the OEM for pwnage. Kreo disclosing their OEM would’ve just made me piggyback them the OEM reviews.

They might’ve the exclusivity deal as I couldn’t find the same sku anywhere on ali/taobao",IndianGaming
"Regarding the reviews thing. I posted this comment on IMKC a week back. 
``` Indian reviewers are a bit delusional. They are overtly loud but all they blurt out is nonsense. It watched a review for the kreo swarm because i wanted to check if an Indian brand has actually launched a good keyboard. 

Only to find the review calling hotswap modular. Modular would mean that you can remove the num pad or the function road to convert the keyboard into full size, tkl and 65 percent.

Then he tells how hotswap is amazing because if you break a switch you can replace it with a new one. That keeps comes with extra switches. 

He doesn't open the keyboard to check the layers, he doesn't tell that the keyboard is north facing and might cause interference. He doesn't talk about the stabs. He doesn't inform us whether the PCB supports screw in stabs. He doesn't inform us in-depth about the software and lack of via compatibility. Because screw Mac and Linux users. 

His main concern what that they keyboard should have had shine through keycaps because it doesn't show RGB.

I wanted to see if the keyboard had north or south facing led. None of the marketing material on the website mentions that. No photos of the PC that isn't obscured by weird graphics.
```

I guess the RGB thing was just an obligatory con they had to mention for the review to look legit. 

They kreo CEO keeps saying that they would provide better support than chinese brands like VXE or Rk but most of the vendors for these product like Meckeys or StackKB will provide warranty. Not to mention you would be getting a better product that is tried and tested by international reviewers who knows the difference between South facing and north facing PCB. 

Honestly i don't care if you rebrand things if the product is good.  i have come to terms with it. Duck Qualcomm and Mediatek. Anyways, atleast don't fake reviews that's how you end up with your cat in heaven instead of your lap. 

I hate companies that engage in fake reviews with every fiber of my body.",IndianGaming
I bought the kreo swarm seeing all the reviews. The keyboard js actually solid and decent. Now I don't know what to do. I just want  to know in the unfortunate event of a repair can I repair it myself will I get the spare parts. I am new to mechanical keyboards. I know we get switch and keycaps and all but what about pc?,IndianGaming

It will be completely unfair to ""review"" kreo products on the channel because I am an employee of Kreo. Even with disclaimers, justifications, or other relevant clarifications, the audience may see it as a ""promotion""

"baki sab theek hai but getting a product from china to india does cost a lot 🤷🏻 I'm planning to import mouse grips and skates (bulk quantity) in total (package shouldn't weight more than 8-10kg) but it'll cost me around 100$ just to get it in customs then I'll have to pay the customs tax aswell so let's assume my order total is 500$+ 100 to the forwarder+18% or more in taxes + good brand packing (it can cost anywhere from 5rs to 15 rs per box+courier (50-100rs) + i believe they do have a team which again they have to give a decent salary right? let's forget the team salary and marketing cost here (let's take my example for importing product worth 500$ ie 42000 + 100$ ie 8400rs = 50,400 rs + taxes on the total cost (let's assume they undervalue my package I'll still have to pay a lil amount on it let's skips the 18% taxes here) total cost comes down to 50400 rs + 5 rs for brand packing per piece which in total I'm ordering around 750 pieces which adds an extra 3750 rs + 30-50 rs for delivery for single piece let's assume that adds up to 30x750 =22,500 rs 

now to total cost is down 50,400+3750+22500= 76,650 rs 

now just imagine jo skates aur grips mujhe factory se 42k me mil raha hai uspe mujhe 76,650 dena pad raha hai aur isme maine custom taxes aur market cost khuch add nahi kiya 

i get where ur coming from about the product being 18$ factory but freight charges,customs, delivery cost, employee cost, marketing adds up to a hell lot of money and freight is not cheap (assuming single keyboard weights around 800g-1kg now imagine importing 100 pieces at once and the cost required for importing that huge ass weight",IndianGaming

"What unreal hate lmao, what's with all the investigations? If the product works well for the price range and has a warranty, why not just use those products try the customer support and see how they do? I've had issues with kreo hive with the red switches failing in a month or two, I contacted them and they sent 2 more switches and tend to respond to most of my messages on WhatsApp. ""Lying fraud to core"" lol people just wanna hate and see others be miserable. If you find something that is better than what this company offers in the price range just go for it. I don't know if they actually are going to have their own R&D on their products once they have the capital. But in all fairness it does atleast for the time being looks like they listen to their customers and actually offer good products at a competitive price range.

Hope they grow man. Hope all this hate goes down in vain. Infact ordered ikarus myself hoping it lives up to the expectations.",IndianGaming
I am using kreo beulga 2 it’s working good. I am playing valorant it’s working fine and sound quality is not bad at the price point ,IndianGaming
"China OEM Imports are more prevalent these days than you can imagine. As long as the products are good and last as long as they usually do, with the quality that Kreo provides, I will personally forgive them for ""hustling"" at this stage in their company life cycle.  
It's pretty hard to build a tech brand in India and Kreo is relatively new in the space. Do you think Razer, Corsair, ASUS don't do shady stuff? think again. Most of the mobile companies are doing the same.  
Every hardware company that succeeds ends up doing some shady hustle. For example Ant Esports copies all their cabinet designs from fancier companies, and they copy them well. So thats that.  
I think we should give Kreo some time in the tech space. Maybe 3-4 years down the line, they would genuinely become one of the Make In India tech companies if they have enough support and capital.",IndianGaming
"damn OP thats a thorough piece but quite aggressive i must say. you got some personal vendetta against the CEO it seems lol.   
the fake reviews and all def is shady, but i guess it does take a lot to get a startup off the ground. i won't comment on the products as i havent tried myself yet, but why is it such a big deal if they're sourcing from china and selling here? india has no good enough manufacturing capability yet and it takes a shit load of capital to set up your own. even if kreo sources from china, at least we have a company that we can hold responsible in case the product breaks down etc right? at least they are giving us good enough price range and not leaving us with the expensive imported razer etc as the only options. 

i'll draw a parallel from the argument of using ""contract manufacturers"" in skincare brands in india - everyone's been trashing them for it. but again - why is that such a bad thing!? everyone ripped on Minimalist for being a rip off of The Ordinary, but hell it gave me the same quality formulation at a MUCH better price point! even my (super qualified and expensive) derma recommended it! i did my own research here and understood that once they have their formulations set, its exclusive to them from the manf side. looks like kreo doing the same with these chinese OEMs - do the design etc, and then sell in india. i think razer did the same when they started out? need to look it up. 

and i do see a lot of clearly real user reviews which are pretty positive. and the kreo support guys actively addressing the complaints etc they get.

startups are supposed to be scrappy. no one is going to give hundreds of crores right off the bat to build a full fledged facility and supply for electronics. takes time. they are young. give them a break man and let them build it out.",IndianGaming

"Bruh you’re tweaking, they’re a decent company and u kinda sound like a disgruntled ex employee",IndianGaming
"""A caring Indian gamer""? This reeks of a personal grudge rather than an actual expose. Most companies take initial reviews from friends and family, most companies do paid YouTube collaborations, and most companies import products from China and sell them under their brand. This isn't some shocking revelation, it's how business works.

Your post is far from being ""correct"", it's just an emotional rant dressed up as detective work. Screenshotting carpets and review names doesn't make you Sherlock Holmes; it makes you look obsessed.

And let’s be real, this level of effort to ""expose"" Kreo? It screams personal vendetta. Maybe you had a bad warranty experience over a budget mouse, maybe something else, but this isn't about ethics, it's about your grudge.

And I am not writing as a fan of kreo, the only product I have ordered from them is a light.

Actually what Kreo is doing is way too much customer centric. I've never seen a company asks it's customers for every tiny problem and making sure that they will fix it in upcoming products. Kudos to Kreo for delivering best in low prices. As a proud Indian I really want to see kreo compete with companies like Razer and Logitech and have a full manufacturing setup in India.

"> 1. This is standard and provides a boost in early-stage feedback

""Others do it too, so it's ok"". 

> Some automated reviews provided to such buyers were sloppy and slipped through wrt those ""chatgpt"" type responses; 


At least you admit to writing and posting the reviews yourself lmao. 

> we’ve removed those and also are removing the remaining few. We also encourage buyers to leave reviews, giving them some assistance with images if they agree (the photos that you see), 


Because it is so difficult for customers to click their own photos in the year of our lord 2024. 

> again these were clearly sloppy from us 

""We'll cover our tracks better next time""

> Amazon Reviews: Amazon’s guidelines let brands group variants to gain traction during launch

Variants yes, completely different products no. And whether Amazon allows it or not, it is incredibly misleading to group completely different products like that. 

> 3. We collaborate with creators genuinely interested in testing our products. While most reviews are barter-based, some creators ask for payments unfortunately (a norm in India’s low CPC market). [...] Again, this is a standard industry practice as it’s one of the best ways to get word-of-mouth going

""Others do it too, so it's ok"". 

> 3. Working with OEM 

Nice spin. The problem isn't that you work with OEMs. The problem is that you don't make original products, while pretending to. A simple reverse image search can find the exact same product on Taobao, with a different logo. OEMs provide some customizability and you have just picked and chosen which exact variant you want. 

Even Apple works with OEMs. But the difference is that Apple isn't just taking some almost ready design from Foxconn and slapping their logo onto it with minor changes.

> The ACTUAL purchase cost of ~3400 is broken down to COGS (including FOB cost) + All forms of freight and pre-last mile warehousing (freight costs come to $55+ per CBM currently) + Leakages + Servicing interest + damages

So it wasn't your actual landed cost. pre-last mile warehousing, leakages (whatever you mean by that), interest, damage (how is that different from leakage?) are not a part of landed cost. 


> , FBA warehousing, FBA last mile etc – these collectively amount to 20%+. 

This is true. 

> 5. Fake info  Any misinformation on our pages was unintentional, and we’ve since refined our listings and product pages. 

Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me three or more times...

> 7. R&D  Each product goes through months of market research and sampling before launch, with around 20-40 prototypes tested before finalizing a model

Market research is not R&D. And you do put out tweets from time to time implying that you are doing something more that what you actually are.  And no, choosing the switch or choosing between IXPE or Silicone foam doesn't count as R&D.  

[Eg. 1](https://x.com/isawsukul/status/1810996713164824794) and [2](https://x.com/kreosphere/status/1807754321943253343) and [3](https://x.com/isawsukul/status/1810682851354108261). This is obviously all for show since I am aware of which factory you buy from - and you don't need to to a breadboarded setup to test a sensor.

"TLDR for this long post isn't small, so i'm not going to edit the main post.   
I'm copy pasting someone's comment here foryou.

Here is TLDR; (I used CHATGPT)

The Reddit post exposes Kreo for allegedly using ChatGPT to write fake reviews on their product pages, paying YouTubers for scripted positive reviews, and lying about their business practices. The user provides numerous screenshots and detailed examples to support their claims. They highlight instances of fake reviews for chairs, keyboards, and other products, noting repetitive use of specific props in review photos that tie back to Kreo’s office. The post also accuses Kreo of grouping different products on Amazon to inflate review counts and hiding negative reviews.

The user claims Kreo's CEO lies about product costs and business practices, stating that Kreo uses OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) products from China but falsely claims exclusivity. They allege Kreo avoids honoring warranty claims to maintain revenue and makes false commitments about product features. The post aims to warn potential customers, especially younger and more impressionable ones, about Kreo's unethical practices and urges the community to scrutinize the company's actions more closely.",IndianGaming
"are you referring to 'chatgpt reviews'? It was a comment I made not post, here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/mkindia/comments/1fngq7c/comment/loj0gpt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mkindia/comments/1fngq7c/comment/loj0gpt/)",IndianGaming
"My post isn’t about white labeling ; actually, I even highlighted “nothing wrong with that” in bold. The real issue I’m addressing is that Kreo is being dishonest in multiple areas/departments, and a company like that shouldn’t be trusted. The title itself is that they're frauds at their core.

Also, sorry to hear you're having trouble with Swarm. Don’t just let it slide, get it replaced, make post if needed.",IndianGaming
"thank u for clearing your part, it was just my assumption. I think it was also influenced because of all the anger when I spotted all these unethical business practices by Kreo. I (we all) trusted you before and still do.

Now that you're here, its important you share your thoughts on this post. Lot of things are very clear scams, especially fake on almost all products and CEO's video on cost of kreo swarm..",IndianGaming
"Logistics costs have the magical property of going down on a unit level as you scale up. My company moves hundreds of CBM of goods a day and deals with Chinese factories a lot, and China to India logistics costs are basically negligible in the larger scheme of things. 

If you are getting keyboards at any scale (say 1000 pcs), you can get it in LCL mode very cheaply. Even with the elevated rates right now, LCL Shekou to Nhava Sheva is not even $30/CBM. Lets be generous and add 50k for origin and destination charges. So at most you would be looking at spending 1L on shipping 1000 keyboards from China to India. So about Rs. 100 per keyboard. 

For 10kg logistics is very expensive. For 1000kg it is very cheap. Tax on keyboard is only 18% GST which they get input credit for. So from the GST they collect from the customer, only the GST on their gross margin is payable to the government. 

If I were sourcing an 18 USD product from China, I could get it landed for 22 USD+ tax (Rs. 2200) at most. China factory also does the product packaging for you by the way, and a basic coloured box doesn't cost more than 10RMB. 

Salary, marketing and all that is a legitimate expense. But be honest about it. You don't get to include those in landed cost.",IndianGaming
"Your MOQ is way too low. Obviously if you are just importing something just weighing 10kg that also retails for less from China obviously you gonna pay more than normal. Kreo is importing keyboards, mouse, mousepads, chairs etc on bulk. You cannot compare your 1 10kg order to their multiple bulk orders.",IndianGaming
all in all even if we skip the marketing and custom taxes+employee salary i have to pay 102 rs for product which costs me 60rs from factory..and you think it won't add up to mere 3400 rs for a product which costs them 18$?,IndianGaming
"yes, sir, that's why I considered that part as only 'dirty' and not cheating. It's still irritating.  
And that's why my main post starts after the amazon paragraph. Part A, B, C, etc.",IndianGaming
"Could you please clarify how much you purchased this account for? Are you the same Kreo employee who previously commented, ""Whatsapp kar leta instead of engagement farming on Reddit""?

I titled this post after discovering the extent of Kreo's deceptive sales practices. While running ads is one thing, fake reviews, paying YouTubers for overly positive coverage, misleading Amazon product groupings, and selling products that fail within weeks/months. Why resort to such tactics?

You mentioned the ""Hive"" keyboard had issues within a month or two and that support sent two replacement switches. **But how would you feel** in case that the switch you had issues with wasn’t compatible? Kreo failed to acknowledge that their keyboard isn’t hot-swappable, but rather hot-pluggable—meaning it only works in 30-40% of cases. This causes switches to lock, leaving users with the option of either damaging the PCB or the switch.

I’ll continue to grow and improve, but I suggest you take a moment to think before making statements. Many of us here cannot afford to support dishonest brands. This isn’t hate, it’s frustration from someone who’s tried to remain objective.",IndianGaming
"There are no personal problems sir. If there were, I would've thrashed Kreo's reply on this post, but user u/second_impact already did that.    
  
Your comment mostly focuses on 'starting a business/running a new business' however, my post shows their unethical business practices to increase sales & fooling customers. Both are different areas. Moreover, I clearly mentioned NOTHING WRONG WITH OEMs. Use it, but you should have product understanding/knowledge to even engage with OEMs.  Moreover, even u/second_impact said ""Nice spin. The problem isn't that you work with OEMs. The problem is that you don't make original products, while pretending to. A simple reverse image search can find the exact same product on Taobao, with a different logo. OEMs provide some customizability and you have just picked and chosen which exact variant you want."" 

My post gave a 90% overview on all areas of 'business  practices' of this company Kreo. It wasn't focused on one part like fake review, fake youtube videos but also on how Kreo has no understanding of products, that is why I shared skincare example because that's whats happening in India on a larger scale.   
**Like how new skincare D2C brands don't understand the formula and repercussions of using bad quality ingredients,** same with gaming OEM user Kreo like brands, how will they solve problems in their products when they themselves don't know any knowledge about the materials & items used in their products which are O E M s. Will they ask factories every time 'why left clicks of mouse fail within 2 months','why a whole row of switches in keyboard fail in first week then randomly starts working again?'  
 They said Kreo hive is technically hotswappable but they suggested users not to mod it, then why add hotswappability? Because they themselves don't know it was hot plug,the factory OEM fooled Kreo, then Kreo fooled their customers. Then users feel scammed and ask for suggestions on reddit/other communities. But it got Kreo their sale & money. They used this time to say 'we learn/back to drawing board etc etc fancy words'

ANSWER ME THIS: For people who understand that new businesses cannot be perfect and we should give them time, absolutely correct. These are mostly people who are comfortable gamers for long period of time, who have used 2-3 products in every category mouse, keyboard headphones etc. They can afford to give a chance to new brand. But what will people like this screenshot do when they feel **they got scammed by fake reviews, false product page info**, paid youtube videos [https://prnt.sc/n5T\_uHMxcHuN](https://prnt.sc/n5T_uHMxcHuN)  

**Startups are NOT supposed to be scrappy, they're supposed to be ""solving"" something or ""providing better value"" from their competitors. At the same time, I also mentioned ""nothing wrong with OEMs"" as Indian market for gaming is simply not big enough for products from scratch. I never for once said they should make their designs.**   
  
**They said** 'we helped customers with images in case they couldn't while writing review' for chair & keyboard & chimera review. You tell me a Bain&Company ex employee,which is tier1 company of the world, Ishan didn't know that this is unethical? Did they not realise that their potential customers will be positively influenced because of more positive reviews?   
**However, I say**. that they did this intentionally, because they had more negative reviews than positive, they had to increase positive reviews on website.   
To understand my point you need to sync the 'amazon grouping' section from my post and 'fake reviews' section from my post. When you switch to 'most recent' option in Kreo's amazon review you'll know how fake reviews offset this negative review, and they were able to fight and keep their 4.5 stars average rating. I also add on that I wouldn't be surprised if they did it as last resort to investors' pressure to reach monthly revenue amount. Sync this point with avoiding warranty claims also.   


You need to look at it from an investigative angle to understand what I shared. Read Kreo's main comment on this post properly with time in your hand and  you'll realize that:

a) the parts where they were completely caught and couldn't back off, they gave smaller excuse and admitted to change it.  
b) the part where they had some opening to defend, they defended.

On the OEM piece and the point on originality, of course it's what we want as well. However each tooling is upwards of $30K to even open, which we will now be in a good place to start doing (if you have a decent balance sheet position to do so, you could make such experiments)
The tweets you've put up are actually us experimenting on recreating firmware and pcb based on a nordic MCU. The r&d  on shape and design is of course based on prints and how PCBs could fit
On the cost...leakages is for instance spillage in shipping etc, and these are all part of cogs bhai (ie how much we procure it till it reaches you)",IndianGaming

"You sound like literally all the companies that have ever existed have had the best practices ever. There is no such thing as hot pluggable. ""a mechanical keyboard that allows users to replace key switches without soldering or disconnecting the keyboard from a computer"" that's hot swappable. The hive keyboard indeed is hot swappable it's just that it is only compatible with Otemu switches. I replaced all the red switches with yellow ones I ordered from cosmic byte and it has been working flawlessly ever since. Although they might not have had the best practices, I don't think any consumer brand does or rather any company does. A consumer I believe should care about is getting good products for their money. I don't believe things like grouping product reviews or doing paid reviews directly point towards the company being fraud. They are selling genuine products that actually work and are priced competitively. Read my review again do you really think I sound like a former employee? I just believe the market has been way too stagnant without any decent products and a few companies that do try to make a name for themselves and provide decent products are just bombarded with this kind of hate.

"bro, i have no allegiance to kreo, but as a moonlighting entrepreneur, i do feel compelled to argue against your point of ""unethical business practices"". 

you do bring some good points, but it seems to me you're quite young/naive coz some of the points show that you've not experienced the real world yet or have an idea of how companies are built.

on reviews, I agree that the company was dumb to not cover track for those photos etc, but the reviews are simple growth hacks. I've launched products on product hunt and begged people to post reviews and I've given them what to post. other examples - my lawyer asked me to vote for them on some legal review list and literally wrote down what to write. I've written LORs for people and they've just sent me the pre-written LOR. my urban company guy gave me an extra 20 mins head massage to just write a review with a photo. Heck, even large companies such as Monday, clickup early on gave us $$$ coupons to write them reviews. I mean every restaurant at this point seeds reviews! For some apps we've made in our past firm, folks would get at least 200 reviews seeded. I think we as individuals are smart enough to see through things at this point.

on YouTube reviews also man, I can guarantee you that even unboxed therapy take money to do reviews. I'm not even mentioning technical guruji coz even brands that I hold with high regard such as Nothing are probably paying him (+his stuff is cringe obv).

those OEM related points you've mentioned and the whole hotplug thing and this company not knowing wtv. That's like saying Steve jobs had to know everything from day 1 (read his history plz), zepto understanding store economics from day 1 (they started as kiranakart that failed), phil knight also couldn't launch a simple product like a shoe!!!, he had to use Japanese assistance and imitated that. You're discounting the entrepreneurial spirit here that aims to figure things out. I can give you so many examples on this it's not even funny. Heck my product is technically an openAI wrapper, and I have zero idea of how their infra works, if they pause someday, I'm dead. Please read more books because I see that you're a part of the startup sub but you don't seem to understand ""failing fast"" yet.

the main unethical thing and a large miss from this I see is the ceo hiring a shitty person / people and that destroying whatever they're even trying to get to honestly...",IndianGaming

If this is adding more than 0.1% to your cost, you need a better shipper. A 5cr coverage open marine insurance contract costs 50k, with out of pocket expenses per claim being <10k.

What are your thoughts on the fake reviews section?,IndianGaming
"> but the reviews are simple growth hacks

See, this is the problem with ""entrepreneur"" types. Calling unethical practices ""standard industry practice"" or ""growth hack"" doesn't make it any less unethical. Yes, the review system incentivizes this, and even uber drivers and UC guys will do anything for positive reviews. Doesn't make it any less shitty. 

> on YouTube reviews also man, I can guarantee you that even unboxed therapy take money to do reviews

Yes. Even international youtubers suck. I know international youtubers can charge anywhere between $1000 USD - $10000 USD+ for a simple collab. But many don't openly call them reviews (just say ""unboxing"") or ""introducing the"" or something, or disclose their compensation. 

Seeding reviews by incentivizing reviewers to post them (without specifying its contents, and giving equal rewards for positive and negative) is not remotely comparable to literally posting fake reviews you wrote yourself/generated using ChatGPT. And giving coupons for further purchases is not comparable to straight cash handouts. 

> whole hotplug thing and this company not knowing wtv

Again, there is a difference between not understanding market dynamics or user preferences (which is what caused Phil Knight or Zepto issues), and not understanding the product you are selling, and misleading customers about it. If you are loudly proclaiming to be a gamer again and again, and if you claim to be  doing market research, you should be able to identify a bad mouse sensor from a good one. 

The problem with Kreo is not hiring a shitty person. It is that they decided to try and capture the market with the help of outside financing, without understanding the existing markets dynamics. Driven by multi-crore rupees debts (secured ones too) with high interest rates, they had to aggressively cost optimize - and do anything and everything to move inventory at a fast pace. Which includes their ad bombing, their perma sales, and their deeply unethical practices. Which is why this brand is pushing everything from fucking tripods to chairs to keyboards. 

I don't believe that a company at their scale can acquire any meaningful level of expertise in so many categories all at once. 

They simply didn't have the breathing room to wait, to take time to develop new products, and go back to the drawing board as needed. 

My company develops its own products, and it is an incredibly time consuming and delay prone process. Test runs warping with injection molding, or design being prone to short runs, or even the sprue marks being too visible have set us back by weeks to months. CNC runs can fail to anodize properly, needing them to be reblasted and re-anodized (and lets hope that it doesn't lead to tolerance issues). Your supplier simply shipped you the countersunk instead of pan head screws. You screwed up and mentioned the part number for an SOD323 footprint part instead of an SOD123 footprint part. All of these can lead to delays and cost overruns.  

Kreos outside debt financing and credit fuelled model that requires paying predatory venture capitalist interest rates makes it impossible for them to take the risks involved in actual R&D. And instead they are stuck trying to push as much of the most cost optimized Chinese crap as they can. 

And hoping that some day their cash generation is stable enough that they can actually make new products (if you want to give them the benefit of the doubt).",IndianGaming

"Simple story:

Dad works for central govt, mom works for state govt, both in 30% tax slab, bad financial planning hence no savings, no medical insurance apart from cghs.

One tiny road accident causing knee fracture and adding to arthritis, needed emergency surgery had to shift 2 hospitals, approved for semi private room but still put in general ward, people shitting in corridors, temporary roofing, too much heat, AC/TV exist without power connection, just to prove facilities exist to the govt inspections. Still had to arrange and pay in lacs, despite having cghs card, for these facilities to get surgery done, later recovered some in reimbursements.
This is what tax paying government servants get. They were among the last people to still have pension but they’re not getting any since retirement 2 years ago, as budget is still pending for their department.

When I was young some of my accidental medical expenses were covered from cghs but generally they paid everything from pocket for me. Couldn’t get admission in any decent govt school, paid full engg fees despite great rank, my peers tens of thousands of ranks after me claimed full fee reimbursements under ews, caste etc. no decent housing, quarters they got were awful, so rented a better house near office. And now I’m paying few lakhs of tax, yet nothing great for me or them in terms of welfare.

"What is your point.  There is lack of tax net coverage in India, which is why one class is heavily taxed. Unless all eligible categories are covered fairly, none of this data matters. If someone is earning 2 crore in India, and someone has an LLP that earns 6 crore and the former pays 40 percent direct tax, and the latter claims deductions for various business expenses and sets up multiple employees who earn less than the tax bracket to add to their overall business expense and thereby pays ways less in tax, who do you think is the real top 1 percent? It’s actually the one who can game the system this way. I’ve seen pay 5 lakhs in cash being paid for shoes in Delhi, half property prices in crores being paid in cash, do you think these folks are paying 40 percent tax ? Forget about the fact as to how stores who have to follow PAN are even accepting such cash (usually the business owners provide PAN of their cook!) for such purchases. 

There is zero infrastructure in India, whether medical, education or emergency services, see property prices what can a person who earns even 2 crore legitimately buy? But there is a class that’s buying and they aren’t part of this tax story, they are the real one percent. This seems to be strategy to let the rich get richer, and the emerging “rich” to stay close to their middle class or upper middle class roots for life by funding the poor so that the politicians can get votes with poverty politics. If the money was being used properly, no one would complain. But Indians turn a blind eye when crores are found stashed in mattress of random small time politicians one has never heard of. It’s so frustrating it’s a joke now.

again, idk the fix, max i can do is voice things that benefit me, thats wat everyone does. two places where i really felt the pain of taxation was, when i needed a device to offer better services to my clients, i could afford the initial price but after taxes, it was almost twice the normal price, i didn't have the money, i need that device to make that kind of money 

and in college i wanted a 3d printer to learn, ender was out of budget, there was this cheap printer in china, which i bought with my hard earned money, i didn't kno about customs, roughly 60% of the price was charged in customs when the product entered india, which dwindling my savings, price became pretty close to an ender while being nowhere as good as one, tho this was fault on my part for not knowing about customs but 60% is alot

"Your points of development are valid however we have poor infrastructure, no benefits to taxpayers in terms of good government schools, or good government hospitals.

Just because we are better in terms of IIT, IIM, UPI, Digitisation, Electricity availability. This doesn't take away from the fact that a lot of basic things are not adequate or quality checked in this country. Advancements in one field doesn't mean that we should stop demanding for better services in other places or stop raising important questions like why only 9% of India's working population is paying income tax, why farmers aren't taxed when they can afford multiple BMWs and Audis, why our metro cities are falling apart in every season(no water in summers yet flooding in monsoon) and spending crores in fixing instead of proper city planning and auditing in the first place to begin with (but our babus are too busy hording money paid by builders for illegal construction, closing lake beds for their new projects, and money taken to avoid any kind of monitoring or auditing).",IndiaTax
"There is another way to look at this:

The issue is we are primarily a poor country. Nearly most people in this sub are really well off by the avg indian std. And that makes them pay more tax than they see returns for. 

For eg do this theoretical exercise

1. Look at effective tax rate for your income. As for this sub most of the people are angry / pissed off as their effective rate prolly comes out close to 40-50% if not higher (direct and indirect. Also caluclations gets more complicated with vehicle ownership).

2. See what other countires have the same or near same and see their qol. (Any country that you can immigrate to is fine including first world countries. And the often used trope of you cant compare with developed countries is cope. That comparison is already happening when a resident is choosing to immigrate.)

See if you would rather live there? If the answer is yes simply immigrate. The answer to bad governance is immigration. You can't change a country or its citizens but you can change your country.

Also its not just tax - a lot of things together come to make a country attractive or not. Like consider the middle east vs the us. Which one most skilled labourers (engineers / surgeons wanna immigrate to?). And India lacks sorely in most of these parameters. When in doubt always look at the feet. The people who can are they leaving? Thats a great indicator to judge qol of a place.",IndiaTax

The banks declare their profits only after subtracting the provisions. The only impact in government revenue I see is via the public sector banks , PSBs provide a component to the government every year based on their profits, so if the profit is less , this component would also be less , but then again it is only applicable to public sector banks and has little impact on government revenue as far as I know.",IndiaTax

Sure, a developing nation needs money to develop, hence higher tax rates and that's justified to a certain extent. What enrages people is the continued, intentional mismanagement and fraud of tax money. Let's be honest, the rich circumvent almost all form of taxation, with the exception of things like GST on regular consumables. I agree that this government has better success rates of making sure that welfare schemes actually reach the needy. But once again, it is the middle class that gets shafted. Poor people need the middle and upper classes to fund their schemes, and the rich can solve any problem by throwing enough money at it.

"Most of the people complaining on SM  are from the middle class and aspire to have some decent standard of living. They pay tax (5%, 10% or whatever) on their income as well pay GST on their expenses. For a middle class family, a house costs easily 10x their annual income anywhere in India. If you are in Mumbai, if median household income of middle class is INR 15 lakhs, a house costs upwards of INR 1.5 crore. If you are in tier 3 town, your income is probably INR 3 lakhs and house costs INR 30 lakhs. They don't have any social security. The middle class doesn't go to government schools and hospitals because of how bad the service is. Except for Delhi and Mumbai, none of the cities have good and efficient public transport. The roads are pot-hole ridden. There is pollution everywhere. 

I am ready to bet other than proper Mumbai, no place in India has amenities like clean water supply, decent drainage and sanitation, decent public transport, 24-hours electricity and all the amenities that makes daily life easier. 

And it is not a rocket science to provide all that. You need competent people with good intentions. I would prefer having good quality basic amenities over IITs and IIMs which benefit only 0.01% of the population.

"I haven't seen a worse post in this channel than this one. 

In order to transition from an underdeveloped country to a developed one, two things need to be fixed: Healthcare and Education. 

I can mention the examples of Argentina which like India had great potential but went to the dumps. And then there's the example of Israel, which decided to fix Healthcare and Education, and scrap all other welfare programmes and transformed to a developed nation. 

Mr. Vishwaguru has chosen to ignore Healthcare even after realising how badly the pandemic has affected us. And despite the industry screaming about unemployability, this idiot has decided to not undertake Educational reforms. Because, this requires actual work than just propaganda. 

Mr. Vishwaguru has been spooked in recent times and his political career would not last long. And with the opposition questioning every bill, Mr. Vishwaguru has taken a very cowardly stance towards administration. I'm sure with the likes of Chota Bheem in the opposition, we don't have much hope. Unfortunately, the truth is we are going the Argentina way. 

The very definition of middle class gets skewed when the government decides that 80 crore people (more than 50% of the population) needs free food grains. On one hand Mr. Vishwaguru talks about Atmanirbhar Bharat and Vikasit Bharat while just throwing away freebies. 

The so called supposed top 3%, paying about 39-42% of the income in taxes is just one major hospital expense away from being plunged into the stack of lower middle class or lower class. I belong to this so called top 3% and unfortunately, I don't have much avenues to hide the income. And don't you dare to lecture me about bad financial planning, I know my game well. There are many like me who have to take care of ageing parents, pay rents, pay maintenence, pay school fees, pay bills, pay EMIs, pay insurance premiums, GST, education cess, etc just to maintain a decent standard of life in a tier 1 city.

The real top 3% earn many many times more than us and have all the avenues to hide their actual incomes. They pay a paltry amount as tax and conveniently escape the tax net.

As far as comparison with Africa is concerned, if we exclude the top 5%, India's population and its per capita GDP plummets to $1130 which is below that of sub-Saharan Africa. And Mr. Vishwaguru is busy shamelessly blowing his trumpet about becoming the 3rd largest economy - while unemployment stands at 6.7% (official figures, actual figures would definitely be higher). 

And as far as Germany is concerned, we rather not compare ourselbes to them. They are doing better than us in every measurable parameter.

Tax terrorism is real and many major Indian MNCs have shifted quite a lot of operations out of India where the tax policies are business friendly. This because Mr. Vishwaguru appointed two most competent people to the Finance Ministry -  Mr. Jetlag and later Sitamoron. This combination of Vishwaguru and Sitamoron has been not just a failure, but it's also an utter disgrace that they continue to occupy the top offices despite their utter incompetence.

As far as people like me are concerned, I hope to have avenues to hide my real income in the near future. And I don't feel any guilt about it. Because we rose despite the government and not because of the government.",IndiaTax

In India, the government counts each lane separately when calculating kilometers, so a 1 km stretch with three lanes is counted as 3 km.

Additionally, how do toll collection and conditions on expressways in India compare to their European counterparts?

"Something about the math seems off. You’re saying that someone who pays 25% tax earns about 55L pa. I earn around 28L and my income tax (after all the deductions) is around 5.5L. That’s roughly 20% already. I live comfortably, I’ve bought a house, I save and invest, etc and I’m happy to do my civic duty of contributing to the betterment of society. But my expectation in a developing country is that 100% of the taxes collected should be used to improve things, be it welfare, community development, etc. What pisses me off are people across multiple levels of government who pocket the money and very little finally makes its way to the deserving ones. For example, every single govt infrastructure project has corruption at multiple levels where things are built at a substandard quality and the one who pockets the money isn’t actually held accountable. When there is public uproar, they’ll pass the buck to the guy at the lowest level who was just following orders. You think that will fly in countries like Germany? People in public office will always be answerable. Meanwhile in India, people in public office will buy a 3rd Range Rover to gift to a relative. So despite all the points you’ve raised about things improving, I don’t agree that it’s enough.

"U forgot the single most important factor. Ease of living and cost of living. That’s the main factor any individual person would look into because it is what he or she has to bear everyday. Yeah. Road and rail and infrastructure projects have come up. But t for a country with such low income, most roads have become toll limited and railways, lets be hinest here, are getting more expensive too. I don’t blame the railways for that, because trains like Vandhe Bharat are more premium. Besides an aspect a lot of people tend to ignore is that we get paid a lot from the world bank and so on for infrastructure development too, and that’s on top of the exuberant road taxes we pay, we also need to pay tolls to use these roads these days. 

Internet penetration and banking services have certainly gone up among Indians. That’s true. And credit where credit is due. 

But the main reason why we have so much brain drain are three very simple factors, ease of living is and cost of living are too high. Basic amnesties cost a lot, while income rates haven’t changed much. Rupee value depreciation against other currencies. That has played a huge role in inflation and rising living costs. Be it fuel or medicines and so on. I personally think our inability to strengthen the rupee is the single most crucial factor that is affecting the country economically. Because when rupee weakens oil tends to get more expensive which In turn has an effect on almost everything in the country. 


As far as an average Indian is concerned. The share of his income he or she pays in taxes is far too high in India and we get very little in return. We could quite simply move to Europe or Us or Canada get paid a lot more for equal or lesser amount of work, pay significantly less on taxes and get better services (free or semi free healthcare, better public transport, better medical facilities, etc.) and also save exponentially more in savings too.",IndiaTax

"Under new tax regime, if you pay close to 55LPA you pay income tax close to 24.5% as the bracket of income above 15LPA is 30%. You can use any calculator online. Add no deduction and you’ll reach that number.

And where are we stalling? Macroeconomic is stable, growth is much more stable, money redistribution is more efficient, infrastructure is built at faster pace (infrastructure under central govt) metro, rail, airport, road, ports etc?

"Exactly, there is no explanation at all about that 55L BS",IndiaTax
"Actually it is possible. Considering 55L as Base Pay. 50% would be Basic Pay which is 27.5L. 12% would be the PF contribution so 3.3L employer contribution and 3.3L Employee. Considering Non Metro 40% of 27.5L can be claimed for HRA(Need to use your parents/In laws PAN if not earning and have proof and file theirs ITR as well) which would be 11L. 
So 55L - 3.3L Employer contribution for PF - 1.5L Employee Contribution - 50k Standard Deduction - 11L HRA - 2L Home Loan Interest if in some other state= 36.7L Taxable Income. Total Tax Outgo would be 9.5L. 

9.5L of 55L is 17% actually. I know some of them would not be ethically right but this is how people claim their Expenses and do not give that much taxes which people assume or say. I haven’t even accounted for LTA, other Office expenses which can be claimed under ITR 3 otherwise % will still be less.",IndiaTax

Banks had to be bailed out because of poor lending and hiding the problem for so long, this was initiated under AQR and we had to recapitalise PSBs plus PSBs are inefficient and low productive, also PSBs primary job isn’t to make profits but to serve the masses so schemes like 0 balance banking etc are majorly taken up by PSBs",IndiaTax

And CGHS is not updated since 2002 or something so due to low rates no one accepts, and newer procedures are not included, had to pay for titanium implants as they wouldn’t reimburse. It’s in lakhs. Moreover hospital tried to do lot of cost cutting they didn’t give mri ct and Xray films, they only gave reports, they didn’t clean rooms properly, they didn’t give all the medicines needed, citing CGHS rates they couldn’t give.

as u mentioned, not even a single urban city to take inspiration from, atleast the start can be offering better to the city where the highest number of tax payers are, one whos paying zero taxes isnt gonna complain about bad power or roads

and one thing that idk if its relevant in this case, but educating people on civic sense, sm destroy public resources, dump garbage, challange law, etc, where my sister lives (same city as me), people have made homes on their land and ramps on the road, limiting the road size to half of wat it should be, everyone, literally everyone in that society, even my sister's house is like that lol, and theres no one to stop it, the infra is there, made worse by the people around it

"We need to increase taxes on the rich and tax corporates in tune with what they pay in Europe. If u wanna do business in India you have to set up base here atleast for taxation purposes. Or else we kick them out. Considering how we are one massive market. Most corporate giants won’t hesitate to set up offices here and pay the taxes we demand. It’s worked in the EU.  It’s worked in China. It will work here too. Because to corporate entities. The biggest fuel is market and consumers. And we have a better market in India. Increasing taxes on the rich and corporate would free up more money for the average Indian which. They will use to buy stuff. Thereby increasing our consuming power too. The reason we won’t do it is because we don’t want to tax the corporates a lot because of their political funding. 

Another factor where India falls behind is that we don’t have a lot of alternative income. And government is heavily reliant on taxes. The US govt. gets paid a lot through defence contracts with American companies and the oil trade in dollars helps them a lot too. Plus the US government have alternative income sources in energy and tech as well. Also, middle eastern countries like Saudi and uae and all they have alternative income sources in oil and gas. Countries in Europe like UK, Switzerland and make a lot through the services sector. Be it legal services or banking. 

Whereas in India, extreme privatisation of state properties and assets has left the government with very little avenues for revenue generation. Imagine if the government of India owned Jamnagar refining facilities instead of having sold it to Reliance. We would have earned a lot of revenue. Imagine the Saudi government having sold of their oil rights to private individuals. The country would never have developed. Or the coal mines in central India to Adani. Imagine if government of India ran Air India and BSNL efficiently. That’s the root Cause of why we are not developing. 

The Chinese are developing so quickly because their government has a hand in almost every pie. Be it energy, technology, defence sector or ai. The state is King. Not private players or corporations. Privatisation is good and all. But our model based on the US Model is the wrong way to go. China has already proved it. So has the Middle East. 

For India to develop and compete with the likes of China, the government needs to take the Center stage.taxing the population alone won’t get the country anywhere. We need to nationalise critical sectors. Like defence, energy, space research and exploration and AI. Leaving it to private players will only strengthen these private corporations at the expense of the country.

Well if you want to know the steps taken by govt to tackle corruption here are some!

Unlike VAT and Cess system, the GST construct of tax invoices matching for input tax credit along with GSTIN has helped identify shell companies and tax evading companies leading to closure of 8L MSMEs a year

DBT transfer post 2017 has reduced blatant corruption from politicians, bureaucrats, panchayat secretaries, basically reducing the role of middle man and reaching the actual beneficiary (by no means it’s full proof but leakages are few)

Fasttag reducing the toll collection corruption.

RERA act by making sure 70% of money from home buyers goes straight to an escrow account and can be only used for direct construction of project and not even for land buying and can’t be siphoned off to another projects or promoters

With improve digitalisation the leakages are bound to reduce and never reach 0
We all know someone who used the system to their advantage and it will favour the rich and powerful, this isn’t left or right wing. Its about who is trying to make the system more efficient and reduce the role of corruption

And the real 1%. Yes they are evading taxes but they are doing the same because they feel they are being taxed excessively and solution given by most middle class folks is to tax rich higher.

They will find ways to evade it again, if you tax the rich they will find the loopholes or move the money abroad.

"That's a silly example. The reason that they do write offs is that lenders have a ceiling on how much they can lend. For example, if a bank has 50K crore limit, then once they lend 50K crore, they cannot lend any more till some of the amount is recovered back. They have to operate within that limit.

If they have 30K in unrecoverable debt, that capacity is locked up as long as it's on the books. So, they go ahead and write it off the books as a loss. The capacity gets freed up and they can now give out more bad loans.

The written off amount is not forgiven debt, but since it's no longer in the books, nobody cares if it's recovered or not. So what usually happens is that the banks settle with the borrower. For example, let's say the corporate entity had 10K crores debt that they defaulted on. They will settle with the bank saying that they will pay a pittance of say 50 cr against it and the loan will be closed.

As the banks keep losing money this way, they have to be recaptalized by the govt using tax money.",IndiaTax

"Jesus Christ you really are delusional, aren't you? Did you do your PhD in Economics from WhatsApp University?

I'll try to be succinct, but my answer to you is this: almost all of your points are basically irrelevant to the big picture. You speak about economics in a condescending manner as though you know one whit about it, which you don't. Is 'bigger economy' the only thing you can think of? India being on track for becoming a bigger economy is not at all impressive, considering the moderate GDP growth, the pathetic per-capita income increase, the growing income disparity, pathetic quality of life, and difficulty in setting up businesses. India is a country with a growing population, and a GDP growth of ~7% is pretty mediocre considering how much potential India has. Even today, most of the population is engaged in agriculture on small pieces of land, which is one of the reasons why individual productivity is so low in our country.

Do you even know how poor India is compared to the rest of the world? We have a huge number of people living in extreme poverty, even though it is 2024, an era of excesses. All you need to do is check the income of people in India, the land and resources available to us are also paltry. India is the most populous country but still isn't even top 3 in military power by a big margin.

You are absolutely delusional if you think India is a leader in IT. The only thing we do is provide cheap software services. Literally all innovation, every revolutionary tech originates in the West, especially the US, because most tech giants are located there and they have a huge amount of funds allocated to research. India doesn't even begin to compare.

Space exploration is one of the avenues where India has done fairly well despite low funding, but it still falls short of NASA, that's the sad reality. Nuclear tech - are you talking about possessing nukes or harnessing nuclear energy? If you're talking about nukes, Indira Gandhi and her administration did a good job by arming India with nukes, but we still have way less nukes in quantity and quality than the USA and Russia. As for nuclear energy, a very tiny fraction of India's energy comes from nuclear power, so yeah, nothing very impressive.

Literacy rates - it's not impressive to be literate in 2024, really. Illiteracy still persists in some pockets of the country, and the quality of education in India is rock bottom. There's a reason why many people who can afford it go to the US or Europe for a Bachelor's or Master's degree.

Healthcare - this is one of the areas where India has done fairly well (all things considered) , but there's still room for improvement. Although we thankfully didn't go the USA route and overprice every single health service to fill the pockets of politicians and Big Pharma, there are many things that need to be done better - the education system to become a doctor needs improvement, degrees can basically be bought. Government hospitals in some areas need to be better equipped (although I've seen some that are quite impressive, props to the government for this), hygiene and sanitation (clean water, toilets, garbage disposal) is something everyone needs access to, and for Christ's sake, stop taxing health and life insurance and sanitary products.

I’ll talk in a language you understand so that you don’t pass on more low quality answers n since u sound very low iq n obviously personal attack make you sound like u need help not just with economics, but also with emotional maturity and lot of vocabulary (other than stupid / idiot or whatever words u choose to use)

Anyway, since u haven’t understood it clearly, I’ll dumb it down n explain it more clearly to you.

India’s GDP per capita being lower than other countries don’t have any meaning . India has a significantly lower standard of living in local context. India’s cost of living is lower than those countries , meaning you can afford more goods and services with your rupees while u stay in India than a normal person can buy in USA or any developed country.

Coming to purchasing power. Indian rupee is a weaker currency n so are your numbers that u Consider ur bible .


To dumb it down for you:


If I’m not importing goods, how will it affect me? I’m buying indian goods and have low cost of living . I can afford a maid , a car wash guy, a plumber, healthcare without creating a hole in my pocket, while an average guy in USA cannot afford this luxury. I have better quality of living in India due to the lower cost of living . 

Here your USA having higher GDP per capita doesn’t even make sense.

This is an example of lower GDP per capita combined with a lower cost of living can resulting in a higher quality of life. ( sorry, have to resort to your language)",IndiaTax

"Again with your stupid logic. I have already mentioned GDP per capita adjusted by purchasing power which takes into account the low cost of living in India. After adjusting for purchasing power, still GDP per capita(PPP) is much lower for India compared to those countries. People in india can buy more stuff 'per unit of currency' but the people in other countries simply earn so much more that their overall buying power is much much more than India. Its like you have a 500 rupee note and other pwerson has 50 notes of 100 rupees. Now, it doesnt matter that purchasing power of 500 rupee is more bcoz u have less of it. While other person have 10 times more buying power than you. I hope this explanation is enough for braindead idiot like you. I have already mentioned GDP adjusted by PPP multiple times but it looks even such basic concepts are beyond that tiny little brain of yours and thats why u keep on paddling the stupid arguments again and again.

You are the one who needs help not just with economics but also some common sense which is unfortunately is not so common for idiots like you.

"Dude u are repeating the same old thing. Im bored come on! How can I make it dumber to explain this?

My buying power is low only when compared to US dollars! But that’s when I’m buying “only in comparison” to US dollar! 
What good is all these bigger number if _an average_ middle class person in Australia or UK or these developed countries cannot afford a maid , a full-time nanny at home after u have a child, if an average middle class cannot afford private schools or tuitions or private medical care in their own country? (Don’t give me the bullhit about free medical treatment, check how difficult it is to get even basic primary medical care in these countries n their wait times are!) 

A middle class person in these developed country cannot afford half of the things a normal middle class Indian can afford doing in their country !

Purchasing power ? if he can leave his country n live in a country with weaker currency, not in his own country, he can probably afford luxury, but does that happen?! So all these numbers work in comparison during trade n currency exchange between the two countries, not in a local context!

I’m hoping u at least now get that all that I told!",IndiaTax
"Lol. You are still acting like a dumb idiot who cant understand basic things. Let me explain you with an example, suppose you can earn 2500$ in india and to avail same level of lifestyle you need 10000$ in those countries. But people in those countries will be earning around 40000-50000$. So, even if you take into account lower cost of living, their life standards are much better since they earn so much more.

And comparing the living standard by ability to hire maid, nanny is very stupid. Wages are very high in those countries simply because people earn much more there. And as such, noone wants to work for low salaries there. In india, there is huge unemployment and underemployment, so cheap labour is available always. THis just proves my point about people earning very low in India. And how are you claiming average people cant afford private schooling there. Its the lower class, that cant afford private school or private medical care. Middle class can afford them and there schooling is of higher standard than most of India's private school. Barring some private schools, most private schools are very bad in India in terms of education quality. In india, only few top earning people can afford the good private schools. Most are forced to send their kids to pathetic private schools or govt schools.

>Purchasing power ? if he can leave his country n live in a country with weaker currency, not in his own country, he can probably afford luxury, but does that happen?! So all these numbers work in comparison during trade n currency exchange between the two countries, not in a local context!

That doesnt make any sense. Nobody is talking about going to countries with weaker currency. I have already explained that even though India has more buying power per unit of currency(say 1 USD), their total earning is much more than India so, they have much more spending power.

Moreover, quality of infrastructure is much much better than in India. They have cleaner air, better road infra, cleaner roads etc.

You still haven't countered my point about they having much more spending power than India because you don't any logical points to counter them despite your non-stop unfounded claims earlier. And why are you still paddling the claims about them not able to afford private school, hospital, restaurants etc ? They can more easily afford these things than an average Indian here. But keep living in your delusion. And why have you sneaked electrician, plumber, mechanic silently ? They can afford them as well. Only thing is they cant afford cook, maid etc because even lower category people have much higher living standards there compared to India. Thats why they demand high wages for unskilled labour as well. This infact proves that living conditions are much better there even for lower class. But even such simple things are too much for you to grasp.

2. As for your argument about tips, those workers are in much better financial situation that workers of same profession in India. Tip is culture in few countries such as US. Sure, they aren't paid well but that is in comparison to similar profession in European countries. But they are in much much better financial condition than people of same profession in India. A waiter in five star restaurant has much better life in developed countries compared to waiters of 5 star restaurants in India. Similarly, a waiter in cheap restaurents in developed countries has much better life than waiters of cheap restaurants in India.

Can you elaborate on how demonetisation helped us.,VidurNeeti
This is a very astute observation here!!,VidurNeeti
"Many till date ask, what was the benefit of Demonetisation? Two:
- A digital financial system created from scratch- UPI, RuPay
- Pakistan landing in FATF grey list at that time.

Pak is no longer under FATF grey list.

Yes, India would've wanted them to remain in it, but most of the objectives by keeping them on it have been achieved, mainly- Ram Temple & abrogation of 370, without any blood shed.

Sometimes, the stated objective cannot be declared publicly.



The seeds of demonetisation were 26/11 & Malegaon blasts which were poised to be Saffron Terror, but were linked to fake currency.


The seeds of PFI crackdown can be traced to same time.


Both were suppressed by a national party for vote-bank. Both designed and run by lSl and supported by XJP family


The Chief Architect for fake currency crackdown was AJ and the Chief Architect for PFI and WAQF is Doval with data collection by an individual who is common in both cases


CAA was let to explode. Hijab controversy was let to explode. If it were not done, the PFI link would have never been exposed leading to consolidation of public opinion & action.


The unsung hero in both the above cases- Col. Purohit. 



2015 BRICS laid the foundation for UPI, DeMonetisation & a parallel system to SWIFT that came to be known only after the Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2022. UPI - the biggest benefit of demonetisation.",VidurNeeti
And why Wal-Mart and other companies have huge shares in UPI and other apps. They could have done something to this. Most users use phonpe and other apps. And will continue to use it. And centre knew it then why?  Same with Flipkart. Why foreign companies hold more shares in those leading companies.,VidurNeeti

1. Let’s be real, India isn’t much more than a knowledge farm. Multiple booms have come and gone, but under a dozen truly significant companies have taken shape in that time. 

2. PLI schemes have had a mediocre response at best, and make in India has been around for a decade, with little to show for it. The former haven’t been implemented as well as they should’ve, and the latter are mostly a rebrand for things that were anyway being made in India. 

3. This is pretty solid. The next step should be technology development and backward integration, which is sorely lacking currently and almost completely derived from China or the EU. 

4. I think fintech boom has come and gone, penetration has already taken place, should see a moderately good growth, though. Excruciating regulations are the bane in the entire finance industry. 

5. Immense potential in healthcare. R&D should be a big driver going forward. 

6. Infrastructure is a fucking joke in India, and certainly not for beginners or the faint hearted. Check this comment of mine- https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/s/hxAbTvljTF

7. Can’t name them, but a a major Japanese conglomerate recently looked into acquiring multiple agritech companies (primarily physical solutions), but after a lot of research they concluded that farmers just don’t have the purchasing power to adopt new tech. 

That simply makes the entire sector uninvestible and unviable. The govt already subsidises a lot of agriculture, esp in fertilisers and seeds, and that would be an additional burden the govt just can’t afford. 

8. I think quick commerce will be by far the most important factor here. 

9. India has seen a decline in tourism for like 5 years now, we still haven’t even reached pre Covid levels, and the lack of infrastructure, and safety is a big issue too. Also the development of other destinations in the region like Vietnam, Indonesia, and Central Asia is causing us to lose tourists.

2) Other than smartphones, I don't see much success in PLI initiatives

4) The boom has already come and gone. It has reached it's potential was a success and now there's nothing more.

5) our exports will continue to increase which is good but we need R&D in this sector too

6) Ports and all is good ig but we need more QC. Bihar had many bridges falling down and Adani airport ceiling, Parliament building, potholes still in many places.

7) Farmer wages which are already poor are declining, they cannot switch to these new technologies. We need major land reforms

8) this sector looks good. There should be good growth but It may have adverse effects for local shops etc who can't compete with them

"I've always said that there are two types of bad history. The first are outright false claims, and it's pretty easy to reject them. But the other type are cherry-picked facts and confirmation bias. If one brings up a cherry-picked series of de-contextualised ""facts,"" it's much easier to drive a misleading agenda, because whilst what one says maybe rooted in reality, they are only half truths and require more research to refute.

Therefore, as someone who took most of what Hitchens said in his documentary at face value and originally found it quite convincing, I highly appreciate this post for shedding light on the misrepresentations within it. I am still skeptical because there were other criticisms he made of Mother Teresa, and I am eager to read what others say about this in the comments, but obviously this post was only about the most common and widespread ""facts"" about her life which he discussed.

In hindsight, it was rather silly of me to take everything he said at face value, particularly given that I can point to examples of him being dishonest when it comes to other topics. I think that documentary was a very good example of how someone can speak to confidently and persuasively about a certain topic whilst omitting key bits of information.",badhistory

"The answer to bad history isn't bad scholarship.

You cite Navin Chawla twice, once as her official biographer, but then a second time almost as though he's a new person. He is not simply a ""government official"" but an author of two books on Mother Teresa. Not just her biography, but a posthumous book that repackaged such of the biography. He is not an objective source by any means. Her official biography was hardly critical. According to his family, he was close to her and she encouraged him not to retire from politics.

Her finances are legendarily unclear. Good luck trying to find out what she spent her money on because you cannot. There's no [audit trail](https://metro.co.uk/2016/03/16/mother-teresa-should-not-be-made-a-saint-and-heres-why-5754127/) or documents indicating what was spent where, so claims about what she spent her money on are simply taking them at their word. The funding she received from shady figures such as Charles Keating, the Duvaliers, and Robert Maxwell are just the tip of that iceberg.

The lack of training with her nuns should also not be understated. They made life-or-death decisions about people in hospice care as untrained medical professionals. That ties into my prior observation. She does not appear to have embraced much outside help beyond the occasional volunteer assistance of other doctors in Kolkata, which indicates that she was sending the majority of her funding either to the Vatican or an outside source that was not the hospice. The fraud being committed here was the lack of understanding of many who funded her endeavors--they assumed they were helping sick and dying people in India, when they were in fact not.

The notion of imperialism also rears its ugly head. Catholicism is not prevalent in India, and her nuns performed secret baptisms on unwilling and unknowing hospice patients, as Hitchens noted. Maybe not high on the list of fucked up things, but it's not great.

A good source that's not from Hitchens (since it seems much relies on his work) comes from an analysis from the Université de Montréal which you can see summed [here](http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/345087).",badhistory

"Yeah I recently re-read the Hitchens book and saw all the accompanying documentaries and on doing it a second time I did find the book somewhat confused. He (Hitchens) couldn't seem  to confine himself to trying to deal with Mother Teresa and would frequently bolster his case against her by attacking some church doctrine that he misunderstood when his case against Mother T wasn't as sensational as he wanted it to be. There was a literary critic named Simon Leys who said that Hitchens' attacks could be boiled down to the fact that she tried to be Christian and I thought that was a good summary. And certainly I don't think that advocating for the Irish anti-abortion law was a good thing but I don't think you can blame that on Mother T like Hitchens did. To me though, the charges that do seem to stick are her taking money from the Duvaliers and refusing to give back the money that Charles Keating gave her after it turned out he had stolen it from retirees, can the OP comment on that? Given the 'scholarship' in the rest of the book I could absolutely see these charges being trumped up though. In addition, there was an Indian doctor, I think his name was Aroup Chatterjee, who made/makes a lot of the same charges that Hitchens did and I wonder if the OP knows whether or not his scholarship was any better, being an Indian and a doctor I could see him being more realistic but I really don't know.",badhistory

"> > “Her nuns refused to install an elevator for the disabled and handicapped in their homeless shelter in New York to make them suffer”

> While the news itself is true, it omits a key detail. By refusing an elevator, the touted implication that they’d let the inmates suffer is mistaken; the nuns stated that “they would personally carry all of them up the stairs” since they don't use elevators. While it is valid to criticise her asceticism on ethical grounds, it is dishonest to leave out the detail that they pledged to personally carry the handicapped, giving a false historical narrative implying malicious intent.

As a disabled person myself, I don't think that changes anything. Prioritizing their own ideology over the agency of disabled people who are dependent on their goodwill is absolutely malicious.",badhistory
"I'm skeptical that you only addressed Hitchens on two counts. He wrote an entire book that was pretty damning, and his main point, iirc, was always that she spent so much more money on repressive boarding schools. He used to claim that she could have spent that money on a lot of more positive ventures but instead chose to emphasize a conservative religious education.",badhistory
"This is some really good work and I've learned something today! I've always been vaguely sceptical of Hitchen's more outlandish claims but never seen it rebuked thoroughly.  

That said, I wonder if you've perhaps been tempted to swing the pendulum slightly too far the other way in one specific area?  

In relation to the infamous 'suffering' quote - I agree it's unlikely that Teresa was doing anything as mendacious as actively depriving people of available pain relief. But you're being rather generous in your interpretation of 'redemptive suffering'. Redemptive suffering isn't intended to be a stick used to push people closer to God, it's considered to be a just punishment for sin. Closest analogy I can think of is how if you're held in prison before a trial, that amount is reduced from your sentence as 'already spent'.  

The reason that's important is twofold. Firstly because it changes the dynamic of suffering from one which 'persuades people get close to God or helps them understand Jesus' plight' to one in which suffering is 'an active and just part of this person's judgement by God'. Secondly, because redemptive suffering, in doctrine, is worthless without forgiveness (i.e. conversion to Christianity and associated end of life rituals). Which means that there is a perverse incentive to focus on conversion 'otherwise the suffering was for nothing'. In both of these considerations, it doesn't create an incentive to create suffering, and doesn't necessarily imply masochism, but it *does* create a value system in which existing suffering is rather casually accepted as 'natural' and 'just' and thus something to be accepted, rather than relieved or mitigated. As per the quote, it *is* apparent that Teresa considered that suffering to result in net good.  

I do wonder the extent to which that influenced the efforts made to procure and utilise pain management treatments. Maybe they'd have strugged to get more pain relief, but maybe they could have acquired it more extensively given the status and celebrity associated with her.",badhistory
"This is an excellent post and i really appreciate you taking the time to dissect what Hitchens says. I find the hitchens obsession on reddit so fascinating because he is touted as “a genius” and “one of the greatest thinkers of the past century” (an actual comment i read on reddit)  it his actual literature does not come close to passing scholarly standards. 

I think people like him because he makes things easy. He’s easy to listen to, because he’s charming and funny. He’s very clever and quick talking, and he knows what words/phrases to use to signal competency so it’s easy to believe him. And he has very clear religious alignments that are easy to identify with. It’s very easy to listen to him and identify with him so he gets a pass on all of the same intense scrutiny that he and many of the people who support him seem to want to apply to everything.

"#                                        Addendum


I would like to add some of my final notes and clarify some of my arguments. This section will respond to some interesting criticisms and provide some original testimony from some medical professionals I’ve acquainted with who’ve met Teresa/ worked at the MoC in Calcutta.  I have been following a lot of the threads which mention this post and reading up more material as well. All names and identifiable information herewith are removed at their request and as doxing insurance.


> **1) Hitchens’s never said that Mother Teresa was a mass murderer! / straw-manning Hitchens**

For the record, I did not say that Hitchens claimed she was a mass murderer! The title of the post is a reference to an old Reddit atheism thread I found to be funny ([linked in the introduction](https://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/7exa77/til_that_mother_teresa_did_not_work_to_alleviate/dq83nko/))! Barring my regret for my stupid typo of “Saint Mother Teresa”, the title is supposed to represent the intention of my post. It was not my intention to write a direct response to Hitchens’s work in whole. If you do read my opening paragraph properly, my intention was to respond to some of the most viciously stupid arguments floating around on Redditsphere on the topic (eg: [a widely shared thread from which I quoted some verbatim](https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/7exa77/til_that_mother_teresa_did_not_work_to_alleviate/dq8cosc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), which to a good extent, is inspired by Hitchens book. Hitchens’s book contains no footnotes or sources I could follow up on, so it was a challenge to respond accurately as well. I’ve already maxxed out on the word-limit of a Reddit post, so I physically cannot respond to all his arguments. And to be fair to Hitchens, some of his arguments have merit. As such, I’d made a conscious decision to only respond to the Reddit narrative which I found to be sub-par.


> **2) Misrepresenting India’s drug laws and other medical criticisms**

I’ve added what I could in more detail within the post itself. My argument (which technically isn’t mine, I was repeating verbatim what palliative specialists in India were saying) was three-pronged; *that the drug laws were strict and costly, there wasn’t enough palliative drugs in the market and most importantly, even most medical professionals were not trained  or knowledgeable in the field*. To clarify, I didn't mean to claim that it was impossible for Teresa to obtain narcotics (before the 1985 NDPS Act at least), my claim is much weaker. However, it is also not true to say it was significantly easy or lawless prior to the '85 Act. Technically speaking, the 1985 Act didn’t *de jure* ban opioid drugs in hospitals either; it was the *de facto* situation due to the extreme strictness of the law. Pre-1985 India did have rules which were lax compared to what came after. However, opioids were still a heavily controlled substance that was rarely seen beyond hospitals for palliative care. India’s post-independence sentiment was prohibitionist and this did overall harm the adoption of the palliative movement here. [Here is an opinion from a historian who is researching narcotics in post-independence India on the same](http://imgur.com/a/lQ97P8n). Although he does not know of any specific law preventing narcotic use in hospitals, he does recognize it was an issue before as well, with India restricting cheaper, local painkillers from the public. He also notes that there was a lack of both supply and knowledge about palliative care in India back then. To further research on how this affected hospitals, [I contacted a senior colleague, a palliative doctor who worked in India during the '70s and '80s](http://imgur.com/a/Dt9azLG). He said that he had heard government opposition sentiments back then. The only way he could prescribe them was through a double prescription (essentially, a government record of your purchase, which inherently limits purchase and quantity and needs qualified doctors knowledgeable about palliative medicine) and thus wasn’t found outside hospital settings. *He also confirms that before ‘85, India hardly used any morphine for palliative medicine, mostly using it for post-operative care.*

**What is very important to note is that the evidence Hitchens brings up of the lack of good analgesia essentially comes after ‘85.** He specifically brings up three instances, the *Fox paper* (‘94), *Mary Loudon* (no date given, one could gauge from her author description on Amazon that she arrived to India after ‘85) and an allusion to it in her San Francisco Home by Elgy Gillespie (third-hand source). From the limited resources I could research, I found witnesses to better analgesia than acetaminophen in her Homes in Calcutta before ‘85, which included morphine. [I was also able to contact another **doctor who volunteered at the Home in ‘82**](https://imgur.com/ShAfof3) and **personally administered better analgesia** (codeine/methyl morphine) than alleged. Now, I cannot gauge the extent of analgesia use in the Homes, but all this provides ample evidence that there was no ideological opposition to pain relief at the home. There is also [a news article from 2005](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-jul-07-fg-opium7-story.html) reporting that the Home used to donate the little morphine they got to cancer hospitals which lacked them. It makes me wonder if the lack of analgesia spoken of comes from general observations by non-medical volunteers. Another objection I heard was that the Home was advertised (to either donors or the patients) as a hospital, which is again plainly false as the Home is named as ""The Home for the Dying"" and Teresa herself denied that she's running a hospital.

As far as needles are concerned, I would say this was my weaker part of the argument. However, I specifically have significant doubt about one of the claims given in Hitchens’s book i.e. *the reusing of needles by ‘simply washing them in cold water’.* Some of the older reports specifically point out they cleaned needles using sterilants like surgical spirit (inadequate, yes, but not as ignorant or harmful as a simple rinse). [I was also able to talk to a retired nurse who worked at Daya Dan and Nirmal Hriday in ‘89 and ‘91](https://imgur.com/zj5PfvL) (3-5 years before Hitchens’s documentary). As a nurse, she was significantly more intimate with the working of the home than average volunteers. In her opinion, the head nurse at the home was very proficient and they were quite willing to take advice from doctors, and the interviewee took classes for the sisters on the same. She found the place to be very clean and the patients well taken care of. In her time at the home, she witnessed that injections weren’t common and **that the nurses** ***did boil the syringes*** **and needles and sharpened them on a stone** before reusing them ([a practice which existed before her arrival](https://imgur.com/pIrXOVM), so possibly extending to the 80s as well), in stark contrast to the allegations. Are some of the claims exaggerated/ witnessed by people who did not have much experience with Indian care and not intimate with the nurses’ work? Perhaps they witnessed a nurse or volunteer who didn’t follow protocols? There could have been instances in which there were negligent practises, sure, but was it the norm? Maybe, maybe not; it’s quite hard to come to any definitive conclusions from the limited testimony. Another testimony is that from Susan Shields of a mission in Africa. However, Shields, by her own admission, was employed in Boston, which brings into question the veracity of her testimony. All this goes to show that this was far from a routine. In my opinion, people who did come to her homes had much bigger problems to be taken care of than injections.",badhistory

">The entire point here is that it is terribly unfair to impose western medical standards on a hospice that began in the 50s in rural India when they lacked the resources and legislation to enforce them given the standards of the country.

This is only fair if you also accept the point that a hospice that began in the 50s in rural India must also follow progress as resources and legislation changed.

On the other side you have the Roman Catholic Church, which, on the outside, appears to be a repressive institution and is distrusted and even hated by a good chunk of humanity.

Now, because they are such a large institution and, arguably, the world's first corporation (or at least tangentially related to another contender for the title of ""world's first corporation"" - the Templar Knights), they, or at least prominent members, have done some pretty shady and terrible things. And lest we forget during the information age, parts of the Church have covered up the most evil of acts - child abuse. So it's no wonder that when they made her a Saint for her works, it was easy to defame her simply due to her association with the Church.

I say all this as a practicing catholic. You will find that any true catholic will be the first to point out the evils committed by members of the church.

">You cite Navin Chawla twice, once as her official biographer, but then a second time almost as though he's a new person. He is not simply a ""government official"" but an author of two books on Mother Teresa.

I don't know if I gave that impression that he was two different people, but I mentioned his full name twice from two different sources. I think his government official credentials are relevant because he is an IAS officer, which in India is the arm of civil service. I'm presuming you aren't Indian, but here it is one of the highest and most prestigious offices a citizen can attain.

>He is not an objective source by any means.

Never said he is. Neither is Hitchens' for that matter. I think it is relevant to hear what Teresa's confidants have to say if we can take her critics' opinions at face value.

>Good luck trying to find out what she spent her money on because you cannot. There's no audit trail or documents indicating what was spent where,

I'm interested in this because I'm mostly ignorant of this, I'm more of a medical professional. Do you have an idea why it is unclear? Is this abnormal? Is there any actual evidence of mismanagement other than speculation? *Your source here is a tabloid.*

>The fraud being committed here was the lack of understanding of many who funded her endeavours--they assumed they were helping sick and dying people in India, when they were in fact not.

But the paper cited does mention that Teresa helped the sick and dying, they were critical of the quality of the care. I think the limitations of her care have more complexity than just Mother Teresa's unwillingness to change.

>She does not appear to have embraced much outside help beyond the occasional volunteer assistance of other doctors in Kolkata

While I do think there is validity in the criticism of the care for the occasional volunteering (which one cannot blame Teresa alone) and resistance to change, I don't think it's entirely clear since doctors and hospitals in Bengal refused to take in the inmates that Teresa took in, often saying that they were dying anyway.

>The notion of imperialism also rears its ugly head. Catholicism is not prevalent in India, and her nuns performed secret baptisms on unwilling and unknowing hospice patients, as Hitchens noted. Maybe not high on the list of fucked up things, but it's not great.

I'm Indian for starters, I know very well of imperialisms history here. Catholicism while not the largest religion in India, has a history far far predating Teresa in India. As for the secret baptisms, while I don't want to outright dismiss it, rests on Hitchens' word (and Susan Shields) than any strong evidence. On the opposite spectrum, Chawla, says that Teresa was very respectful of other religions. Again, his word. Since I haven't found a conclusion here, I haven't posted it.

I commented on it a bit, not much since I don't have a good understanding of how charity funding works. The Duvalier's donated a 1000 dollars, not millions. There is no indication that Teresa knew that the Keating money was fraudulent before his conviction. The reason why she didn't return it after his trial isn't clear, but it is possible that she'd spent it already. It is true that Mother Teresa associated herself with shady figures, but I haven't found indications that she was involved in the shadiness''.

Wrt to redemptive suffering, I am not going to pretend that I know the theological details of it. I am not Catholic and I don't have any reading in Catholic theology, so someone else can better articulate an answer here. My understanding is that Catholicism sees suffering optimistically, but not necessarily to the point of glorification. And the other gripe being it's used to support the idea that she withheld painkillers as a result of her beliefs.

I think you raise an excellent point wrt to how her religion may ultimately have played into her decisions. It deserves more attention to detail than Hitchens' broad rash take on it.

I am by no means an expert, but I attended Catholic School for the vast majority of my life, and I have been forced to read the Catechism of the Catholic Church many times over. That being said, the church does not condone suffering. Suffering, in the church's eyes, is a result of original sin not a punishment for sin. The analogy I would use is if you stuck your hand into a pot of boiling water. Your burns wouldn't be a punishment, but a consequence from the actions you freely took. The Anointing of the Sick, the ""end of life ritual"" you reference, is according to the Catechism, ""meant to lead the sick person to healing of the soul, but also of the body if such is God's will"".

"## Addendum contd.

&#x200B;

>**3) Keep your friends close and your enemies toaster: associating with alleged sinners**

*Hitchens’s section on the above is mainly devoted to events connected with her visit to the United States in May 1985 to accept the Presidential Medal of Freedom.* One set of objections is that Mother Teresa visited repressive one-party states which she ought not to have visited (Haiti, Albania, Ethiopia, and Guatemala), or, granted that she visited them, that she ought to have condemned her hosts. Hitchens concedes in two of the cases (Haiti and Ethiopia) that Mother Teresa's visits, her refraining from attacking her hosts, was possibly connected with her desire to open convents in those countries. He also does not mention that her declared aim was to establish a presence for her order in Albania, nor does he mention other countries (like Cuba and the Soviet Union) where her visits were expressly and successfully made for that very purpose.

Although much is made of a photograph of Mother Teresa receiving an official award in January 1981 from the then wife of Jean-Claude Duvalier (at that time the President of Haiti), no substantive allegations are made about Mother Teresa arising from her visit to Haiti, and the broad claim of friendship with despots is nowhere substantiated. In early 1981 Madame Duvalier enjoyed widespread approval for her concern for the poor in Haiti, visiting deprived communities and establishing health clinics. Hitchens omitted this from his book, [but he had previously referred to it in an article in The Nation in 1992](https://deeshaa.org/teresa-ghoul-of-calcutta/). The sum purported to be donated by the Duvaliers was later found by Navin Chawla to be a mere sum of [1000 dollars](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-mother-teresa-her-critics-choose-to-ignore/article5058894.ece).

Other conclusions unfavourable to Mother Teresa are drawn from acts susceptible of a favourable and non-political motive. *Mother Teresa's wreath-laying at the grave of Enver Hoxha was taken by Hitchens to be an act of ""homage"" or “tribute to its Stalinist leader” on the basis of hearsay*. An alternative interpretation is that it was an act of forgiveness. Hoxha's regime had denied appeals by Mother Teresa to allow her dying mother to leave the country in 1972. The sociologist Dr. Gëzim Alpion regarded the wreath-laying as an act of forgiveness: ""a well-calculated and well-meaning public gesture"" for the Albanians and for people in the Balkans generally at a particularly tense time. Hitchens' argument that Mother Teresa had dubious political sympathies which connected her with fascist excesses in the Balkans in the 1920's, 1930's, 1940's and 1990's, has been [contested by Alpion on the ground that it is flawed](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1461319042000296796).

In another place Hitchens states that Mother Teresa congratulated the then US President Reagan for his “policy in Ethiopia"", *namely to support the territorial integrity of Ethiopia against the separatists in the then province of Eritrea*. Hitchens means to create a direct link connecting Mother Teresa with US policy in Ethiopia and Mengistu's alleged use of famine as a weapon against his own people. What Mother Teresa said (""Together, we are doing something beautiful for God"" - *quoted by Hitchens*) related to *Reagan's response to her urgent appeal to him to send food to relieve the famine in Ethiopia*: she was commending him on his humanitarian response to an immediate crisis, not congratulating him for supporting the territorial integrity of Ethiopia.

&#x200B;

>**4) Allegations of secret conversions**

Some people had DMed me asking about what I could find on the alleged practice. I didn’t want to talk much about the secret conversion allegations in my post, mainly because it is a highly politicised issue (in India by the far-right) and I wanted to steer the main discussion away from that.

To start with, the morality of proselytization itself is a complicated and controversial issue. *Is proselytization intrinsically wrong*? That is a discussion for another time. However, *I do want to point out some flaws in Hitchens’s allegations.* His evidence largely stems from a single source, an ex-employee of the Order, Susan Shields. We are not given any details who she is or what her position was in the Order. From her own account, she was employed in Boston, a largely Christian area, not Calcutta. What pops out to me is that conversions are not valid in Catholicism if they are performed [without consent](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P2X.HTM) and nuns generally wouldn’t perform baptisms if priests were available. Baptisms are also usually recorded at local parishes, which should be easy to verify. Another unusual minor detail is the dabbing; in the Catholic faith, adult baptisms are valid if done by [immersion, pouring or aspersion](https://www.catholic.com/magazine/online-edition/dunk-pour-or-sprinkle-how-to-baptize-new-testament-style); not dabbing. *It’s rather strange for otherwise ultra-orthodox nuns to be carrying out significantly religiously incorrect practices*. To me, this sounds more like an exaggerated piece of testimony from a past employee.

There is also a video floating around in which Teresa claims to have given patients “tickets to heaven”. We are not given the context or the scope of her short speech. From what I could gather, there are some nuances to what actually happened at the Home. To give some context, India post-independence was very anti-colonial. Proselytisation would have created humongous issues with the general public and the government at large. Although there were allegations of coerced baptisms in Teresa’s home from her earlier critics (local Hindu priests, as noted in Chawla’s biography), they had significantly died down as people became more aware of her work. Teresa had significant support from the non-Christian community and the local government in Bengal. A large share of her intimate helpers were non-Christians. The Charity's spokesperson Sunita Kumar is an orthodox Sikh. It would be very strange for Teresa to be carrying out “secret conversions” on the side without receiving backlash within a largely Hindu city. In Teresa’s own words, she was against [forced secret conversions](https://mattersindia.com/2016/09/an-interview-with-mother-teresa/), calling it “[a terrible humiliation for anyone to give up religion for a plate of rice](https://www.dailyo.in/lifestyle/mother-teresa-on-conversions-and-other-things-mohan-bhagwat-rss/story/1/2240.html)”. Teresa even had pushback from orthodox Catholics claiming she was religiously indifferent. There is no evidence given for forced conversions where people had to trade their religion for sustenance. What probably happened is that some of the dying whose religion could not be identified were given blessings; “a conditional baptism of desire”. [In an interview with Patricia Treece in Nothing Short of a Miracle](https://imgur.com/a/FKwhddv), a priest who worked with the Order mentioned that if dying patients were brought in, who by virtue of being comatose for example, could not visibly be identified or state a religious preference, sometimes the priests would a baptism which was “conditional” on the desire of the patient, which they were free to reject and does not count as a true conversion. This did not extend to all patients and strictly not to those who recovered and were healthy to leave and could state a preference. Teresa’s philosophy was to spread the 'fragrance of Jesus'. The Order was quite proud that they weren’t extending Christianity through coercion. In Mother Teresa’s own words, she wanted her Hindu and Muslim helper to become ""better Hindus and better Muslims"". In her words, although she would have been joyous that everyone came to follow her faith, her intention was to help others in their spiritual journey.",badhistory

She fired back at them for being ""Mems"" (a pejorative arising from the title for white upper-class colonialist women), only caring for the rich and not trying to be one with the poor and the Indians. She got along very well with Indians in her lifetime and she is revered here across religions.

And Teresa never portrayed Calcutta as the epitome of poverty. Whenever she spoke about her work there, she also mentioned similar work carried out by her followers elsewhere. She helped the destitute of Calcutta as much as those of Rome, London and New York. She is recorded of highlighting unlooked poverty in rich countries while praising Calcutta for it's love.

>You will find that any true catholic will be the first to point out the evils committed by members of the church

There are bad, bad people of any religious denomination (or lack of one), that would never admit to such a thing. That doesn't mean they're any less ""real"".

It's also trivial to disprove, as there are fundamentally divided opinions on various parts of the faith where each side sees the other as being evil. And that includes things that the church has changed opinions on recently (as in, in the present, there are differing opinions). I suppose saying that not believing in a subset of the current pope's opinions can be defined as ""not being a true catholic"" though, but then again papal infallibility is not a strong majority catholic opinion either :)

EDIT: your statement below, ""They may not be able to see that they're doing the wrong thing yet again right now because they're blinded by concerns that have been fostered by the wealthy to sell them things."", does help clarify your meaning a bit, in that you're focusing on the past and not the present, but that still isn't true in the case of e.g. condom use - where there *today* exists arguably ""true catholics"" arguing both for and against it, each arguing that the other side is evil.",badhistory

>I'm interested in this because I'm mostly ignorant of this, I'm more of a medical professional. Do you have an idea why it is unclear? Is this abnormal?

I have my cynical notion, which is that she didn't want people to know, and the less cynical notion, which is that she simply took what was necessary to run the hospice as she saw fit and giving the rest to the Vatican. Either way, that's not what people were donating to.

>But the paper cited does not mention that Teresa did not help the sick and dying, they were critical of the quality of the care.

To be clear, the explicit notion of donating funds to Mother Teresa was to fund her hospice care. That much of that money was apparently not spent on the hospice was fraudulent. Outside of India, Mother Teresa's charity was described as a hospital and she did little if anything to change the notion despite spending a great deal of time away from the hospice on media tours and meeting with heads of state.

>While I do think there is validity in the criticism of the care for the occasional volunteering (which one cannot blame Teresa alone) and resistance to change, I don't think it's entirely clear since doctors and hospitals in Bengal refused to take in the inmates that Teresa took in, often saying that they were dying anyway.

Again the issue here being that she had access to millions but instead left the life or death decisions up to untrained nurses. That falls entirely on her.

>As for the secret baptisms, while I don't want to outright dismiss it, rests on Hitchens' word (and Susan Shields) than any strong evidence.

"Context is King.The author's tone makes a huge difference too. To give an example of your point: 

Out of context, Abraham Lincoln can be portrayed as someone so polarizingly unpopular that his election directly caused the secession of half the nation followed by a protracted and bloody civil war that took over a century to fully reconcile and who's effects are arguably still being felt today. It could be said that Lincoln was a tyrannt who governed by fiat and vindictively abolished southern property rights over their most essential chattel as a punishment for defying him and as a manipulation tactic to draw foreign allies to his side of the war through claiming the moral high ground. He could also have been said to have been notoriously fickle and setting up a revolving door of military Supreme commanders until he finally settled on leaving Grant in charge of the entire army; Ulysses S Grant being an Alcoholic who's favorite logistics strategy was to send predatory agents to recruit unsuspecting immigrants off the docks to be sent to die en mass as canon fodder in Lincoln's meat grinder war. You could even say that Lincoln was lazy and refused to prepare a proper speech after Gettysburg, instead hastily scrawling a speech in a napkin while in transit. 

You could say a lot of those things, out of context, and there would be a kernel of truth to them, though spun and colored by the author's voice. Had the south won the war, that might have even been how those events were commonly taught.

Ok that makes sense, I figured there was more to the story. Like I said earlier, I don't think there was a lot that she did that any other catholic nun wouldn't have done. Hitchens case could have been much stronger if he had, for the sake of argument, confined himself to only criticizing those things that Mother T did that weren't some sort of Christian doctrine.

>His work is better but if the claims are the same, then my reservations still stand (his work is the basis for Hitchens' documentary). AFAIK, Chatterjee never practised in India and was/is a communist (from communist Bengal), so I don't see him as a person with no vested interests. That doesn't discount him per se, just something to keep in mind.

Chatterjee was Bengali but he was from Kolkata where Mother T's hospital was and he did practice medicine there (or at least study it there). Also the only thing I've read said that he worked with ""a left wing party"" not necessarily a communist one but since you obviously know more about indie/bengali politics ill assume you're correct. But I also read that he basically made the same claims that Hitchens did and which you responded to so I don't think his arguments hold up any better.

"###Addendum contd. 

&#x200B;

>**5) The Money Matters**

Like I previously mentioned, *there are no real hard details given on how much money was donated and how it was spent* beyond questionable testimony by Hitchens and disconnected numbers from others. Unlike other charities, Teresa banned fundraising, so the money donated to the Home was for general purposes. Some other critics do give better details, but aren’t clear how their figures were calculated. Some papers quote Nuzzi’s book ‘Original Sin’ for the enormous cash deposited under Teresa, but alas, Nuzzi only speaks a few paragraphs about it from rumours within the bank, not numbers.

I was able to obtain some financial information on the UK Home and the Calcutta Home. *Disclaimer; I am not educated in the finances nor is it my expertise, so take from this what you will.* Contradictory to the 7% figure floating around, [the UK Home](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id=uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_state=maximized&p_p_mode=view&_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_mvcRenderCommandName=%2Fcharity-overview&_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_organisationNumber=3958915) spends the majority of its income for charity purposes. In India, one can obtain the [FCRA documents](https://fcraonline.nic.in/) of the Home, which is the foreign donations received by the institution. Although this is not a comprehensive measure of the total assets belonging to the Home, it is within reason to say the majority of the Home’s income comes from foreign donations (as Hitchens also hinted). I was able to obtain the [records from the years 2006-2019](https://imgur.com/FS9cqVo), which I’m assuming to be typical (I could find much significant fluctuations in any year).  I couldn’t find any glaring misuse of the funds in their FCRA reports. They had [utilized 99% of their foreign funds](https://imgur.com/ntUyp94) in that time frame for specific purposes (construction, welfare, vocational training, treatment etc. as shown in [this report from 2010](https://imgur.com/mpaBvjo)). There are also some magazine reports containing their [FCRA details from 1980-1985](https://imgur.com/AIcjjaW) with similar numbers. Again, I don’t think any of this is really conclusive evidence. *This is to point out the glaring lack of 'good' evidence from her critics.*

&#x200B;

>**6) Hospital expenditure**

I don’t have much to add here other than sharing an [exchange I had with a technician who donated some heart equipment to Teresa](http://imgur.com/a/PGmDuNr). He spoke quite highly of her (again, praising the cleanliness and care at the Home) and said that there was no push or request from Teresa for her treatment and was a company decision to donate their equipment to a diplomat.

&#x200B;

>**7) Psychoanalyzation of the self**

To quote the Joker, don’t play psychoanalyst with me, boy! I have my own biases, I will concede as much. I am non-Catholic Protestant who doesn’t care about sainthood. I primarily consider myself to be a medical professional (in training). I have my biases to view at least some of Teresa’s work more favorably than others. I do not believe psychoanalyzing authors, even Hitchens, to be significantly fruitful and adding to the discussion.

&#x200B;

>**8) Some Conclusions**

*So, who was Mother Teresa?* It’s a complicated question, as any description of a person would be. Neither am I going to feed you what your opinion of her should be. Teresa was a celebrity Catholic saint with her own share of flawed beliefs and practices, like any other fallible human being. A lot of the praise Teresa gets depend on how positively disposed one is to Catholicism. My gripe is that if Teresa was the absolute stinker she is propped up to be, it would literally be a miracle that people from all viewpoints, from Marxists to Hindus and the Nobel Committee to the Indian government, to have highly positive things to say about her. There ought to be better discussions of historical figures that do not resort to caricatures.

I can't explain it completely, but Albanian culture isn't as judgemental or nationalistic as Western Europe or as other parts of Eastern Europe. This may explain some of her character traits. For example: If you were traveling through random small towns or the mountains of Albania and asked for a place to stay for the night, you would easily find accommodations. It's one of the main reasons the Jewish population grew significantly in Albania during WWII and Jewish people from other countries hid out pretty well in Albania, even though it was under Italian and German control.

I find Hitchens entertaining even though he made many fallacies throughout his career. But his hit job on Teresa never sat well with me. It seemed personal for no logical reason. Part of me thinks it is due to his imperialistic ideologies and due to the fact that she was Albanian.

There are a LOT of things wrong here:

1. MT's organization generally built nothing more than small chapels in their facilities.  They weren't building expensive cathedrals.
2. MT's organization is organized around a monastic order, yes.  However, their operations are those of a local Catholic diocese or perhaps merely the convent itself.  There's no secret way to funnel that money around.
3. The Catholic Church is not a single organization.  It's a bunch of organizations in a broader movement.  There's no registration or corporation for ""The Catholic Church"" listed anywhere in the world.  The reality is that the Catholic Church is, at its core, a confederation of local churches: the dioceses.  So long as the diocese is in communion with the Pope, they're Catholic.
4. There are few ways to transfer resources between dioceses under Roman Catholic Canon Law.  Thus, selling off a bunch of churches and/or their stuff in one place won't help cover the costs of restitution in another.  Each diocese is legally responsible for itself.

> When you had vast resources that would have bought far better care for these unfortunates,

Better care *could not legally (and in some cases not even illegally) be purchased in or imported to India for any amount of money*.  That's kind of the point of the original post.  

Most of the offered health care to MT was offered as dignitary care.  Basically, the hospital wants the publicity of having her as the patient.  

She wasn't in the business of denying people medical care or access to it.  She wasn't in the business of providing it, either, and those who came to here were well aware of that.  They wanted a place where they could get food, a bed, and a place to clean themselves.  And that was MT's ministry.",badhistory

But as far as I understand this, these are notions. What other evidences do you have?

>That much of that money was apparently not spent on the hospice was fraudulent.

As far as my readings go, she did spend money on building more charity houses, emphasizing quantity. Again the finances is not something I've read well.

>Mother Teresa's charity was described as a hospital

Her mission statement was hospice care and pulling people out of gutters. Media misrepresentations. Anecdotally, Teresa was true to her mission in that respect that she'd genuinely pull the poor from the streets and Robin Fox, her critic also reported the same.

>Again the issue here being that she had access to millions but instead left the life or death decisions up to untrained nurses. That falls entirely on her.

Valid criticism as I noted in my post. The question here is whether she had the resources to train medical professionals in her care, and by resources I don't merely mean money. It's about willing trained medical professionals who would help her and if medical care in India then was satisfactory. \[I personally know this is an issue in India even now, where there is shortage of doctors with most of them concentrated in urban areas and lack of facilities in rural areas\]. If the majority of her volunteers were nuns, that cannot be squared only to her. There is evidence that there is poor quality in their care as I have noted, but what is the evidence that this wasn't an issue that plagued India as a whole and not just the MoC?

>Wasn't she also accused in India of doing this by Indians?

Indians are not the most reliable sources when it comes to conversion cries here because accounts of this are always from Hindutva (radical right-wing) groups. There is so much more to be said here, but right-wing Hindu politics has its own beef with Christianity and conversion and caste.

>As a medical professional you should know better than to criticize a source simply because it wasn't authored by a historian or sociologist.

I'm just pointing it out since it's touted as a source. Don't you think it's relevant that a paper cited by the media about the ""dark side"" of Mother Teresa based on history is not written by experts in the historical field? Moreover, the paper is on paper aimed at measuring the altruism of Teresa, not history.

&#x200B;

>The work they produced was in fact a review of all of the literature written about Mother Theresa so it did not rely solely on Hitchens' work.

As I said, review of literature, not original research, not an new source of criticism, but more of a rehash of what her other critics had to say. It did not provide any new information her critics have already given.

>You can see they cited [dozens of sources](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0008429812469894?rss=1&ssource=mfr) which included your own work by Chawla and Bill Donohue of the Catholic League, as well as Hitchens and Aroup Chatterjee, a Kolkata native who now lives in London and is a medical professional.

I'm aware that they used more sources than just Hitchens, which is why I said **mostly.** They only had 4-5 critical sources in my memory, with Hitchens cited the most,  then Chatterjee and Robin Fox, with no indication if they were sharing sources (which they were). They also note that the vast majority of the writings of her were positive, but dismiss it without actually giving much reason why they aren't credible or why the critical works have more credibility.

&#x200B;

>Aroup Chatterjee, a Kolkata native who now lives in London and is a medical professional.

While he is a better critic than Hitchens, his work is basically Hitchens' work since Hitchens used his research for his documentary and book. I would like to hear unique criticisms of Teresa from Chatterjee from you if you do have them. I do have reservations on the academic credibility of his original book, it is published through a publisher Meteor books which only has a history of poetry (maybe of because the subject matter) and I don't think it had been received all positively.

While I was looking for the above, I found [this account which may interest you](https://www.smh.com.au/world/lost-in-faith-and-faith-lost-20081101-gdt168.html) - it's by a doctor who, before med school, was a nun in Sister Teresa's order. She disagrees with Hitchins' view of Teresa but her own account of her field work highlights some of the same attitude problems others raise:

>Colette Livermore, then known as Sister Tobit, almost died of cerebral malaria in Papua New Guinea, her first overseas posting in 1977. She was given nothing to prevent the disease...

> If I had died or become disabled, the order would have said, ""It's God's will"", yet simple measures such as seeking medical advice, taking chloroquine two weeks before we left Australia, using mosquito repellents, becoming informed about malaria, and having a readily available treatment dose for the disease if the preventive measures failed, could have averted the whole scenario.

>The assumption that God's loving care would protect us was used by the order to justify a dangerous lack of foresight and sloppiness. All of us sisters should have gone to the doctor for travel advice and vaccinations and learned all we could about the diseases present in the Gulf [Province], so that when I woke up shivering with fever and classic symptoms of malaria, I could have started treatment doses of chloroquine or quinine immediately, before the parasites had built up to dangerous levels. But none of us realised how dangerous cerebral malaria can be, and I was left untreated, to have seizures alone.",badhistory

But it sounds like the half that you're unable to refute is kind of damning. Not one cent of donated money should have gone to the church if it was donated under the assumption that it would help patients directly. And there is no excuse for failing to hire people with real medical training and endeavoring to provide real medical care when you have that much funding.

I think you've done a great job of illustrating some shoddy evidence used by Teresa critics, but I think you overextend by implying that their core claims (that her fundraising was disingenuous and her medical work less effective than it could have been even given the time and place) are baseless. Why should those millions have gone to her instead of a secular medical NGO?",badhistory
">But as far as I understand this, these are notions. What other evidences do you have?

A good question that they have still repeatedly failed to answer. But here's all of the unthinkable scenarios. Since the money was clearly not spent on the clinics themselves (and that should be easier to account for), it was either given to the church, put in a secret fund with zero oversight, or stashed in an untraceable bank account. None of these actions is befitting a charity.

>As far as my readings go, she did spend money on building more charity houses, emphasizing quantity. Again the finances is not something I've read well.

For the millions she received, she did not spend in equal measure. That's why it is highly suspect what was done with the money.

>Her mission statement was hospice care and pulling people out of gutters. Media misrepresentations. Anecdotally, Teresa was true to her mission in that respect that she'd genuinely pull the poor from the streets and Robin Fox, her critic also reported the same.

And to my point, media misrepresentations she clearly could have pushed back on, did not, and benefited from.

>Valid criticism as I noted in my post. The question here is whether she had the resources to train medical professionals in her care, and by resources I don't merely mean money. It's about willing trained medical professionals who would help her and if medical care in India then was satisfactory. \[I personally know this is an issue in India even now, where there is shortage of doctors with most of them concentrated in urban areas and lack of facilities in rural areas\]. If the majority of her volunteers were nuns, that cannot be squared only to her. There is evidence that there is poor quality in their care as I have noted, but what is the evidence that this wasn't an issue that plagued India as a whole and not just the MoC?

There are other charities that come to mind, SmileTrain, Doctors Without Borders, who have no issue with getting physicians and other trained medical professionals to move to countries in great need, for both short and long term care. This was within her abilities. She also could have trained nurses. Chatterjee stated that after she died that both hygiene and quality of care improved, as well as nurse training. Whether Mother Theresa was malicious or incompetent resulted in the same amount of death.

>Indians are not the most reliable sources when it comes to conversion cries here because accounts of this are always from Hindutva (radical right-wing) groups. There is so much more to be said here, but right-wing Hindu politics has its own beef with Christianity and conversion and caste.

Chatterjee is, as far as I can tell, left wing.

>I'm just pointing it out since it's touted as a source. Don't you think it's relevant that a paper cited by the media about the ""dark side"" of Mother Teresa based on history is not written by experts in the historical field? Moreover, the paper is on paper aimed at measuring the altruism of Teresa, not history.

I think it is not unrealistic for a publisher to not take on the risk of a book criticizing Mother Theresa. What is required to make one an expert in Mother Theresa? She died in the '90s, not the 1890s.

>As I said, review of literature, not original research, not an new source of criticism, but more of a rehash of what her other critics had to say. It did not provide any new information her critics have already given.

I implore you to look at the other sources cited. There are DOZENS. Not all are negative. Quite a few are not, in fact. You keep saying mostly when I point out that they're not even remotely comprised of things Hitchens has said.

You also tie Chatterjee and Hitchens together when they are simply collaboration partners. Chatterjee's work involved interviewing over a hundred nuns and primary sources. Hitchens' work was certainly more sensationalist and slanted, but Chatterjee was not his only source by any means.

He also tried himself in interpreting the bible as a lay person at a point in time in which the church wasn't at a good place.

The issue isn't the ""arguably evil"" part.  It's the ""organization"" part.  The Catholic Church simply isn't one.  It's a movement, one with far less cohesion and centralization than most people think.  

Most ""arguably evil organizations"" are at least organizations--cohesive units that have a corporate unity somehow.  The Catholic Church simply doesn't have that.  

> I mean, how else could an organization be evil?

See also: the CIA.  Totally different thing, with considerably more centralization.  They don't have *any* face parts.  And most corporations' faces are mere facades, and we all know it--it's not even a functioning fiction anymore.  

> Yes, and the various popes hold and has held various opinions, some of which are considerd to lend credibility for various percieved ""evils"".

Well, yes.  There have been some really awful Popes--a *lot* of whom didn't even take the job that seriously in large part because the Pope was also a temporal king for a good chunk of the medieval and modern eras.  His electors had been the Christians of the city of Rome for a long part of *that* time.  

And no, papal infallibility is very narrowly defined.  Since the dogma first came into formulation in 1871 (yeah, that recent--it was largely an effort to bolster the Pope's claims with respect to the Italian Unification effort that the Papacy opposed until they ultimately got ""you and what army""'d by Mussolini), it has never been invoked.  The seven statements most Catholics were cited happened *before* that time.  

Hell, there was even a Pope who at various times voiced positions that sound an awful lot like actual, defined heresy.   

So let's not mince words: the Catholic movement has done a lot of horrible things, the Diocese of Rome has done a lot of horrible things, and dear God, there have been a lot of bad calls by bishops and/or bad bishops.  There are simply a lot of Catholics that want to pretend that none of this happened.

I'm not Catholic.  Therefore, I have no such compunctions.  If you're going to hate the Catholic movement, please do so for what it is (bearing in mind that I'm saying that the only institution that would be the Church is the local dioceses), not for what you may imagine it to be.",badhistory

This is a religious order, so it is held accountable by the Vatican and a part of its belongings are Vatican's property, as every Roman Catholic religious order in the world does. It is known inside and outside the community. I'll use an exemple : if I donate to my local parish, part of it goes the diocese, and since my parish is a big one, it supports five orher parishes. Part of the diocese money goes on different funds on a regional and national scale, meant to help varoous categories of people, institutions and associations. The rest goes to the Vatican, which then use it in the same way, helping people and institutions throughout the world. This is the way it works - not perfect, but not bad either.

A more revelant point I think is the cost of running a place like this, and having multiple places alike. You need to think in terms of building, of furnitures, on food and whatever clothes and sheets and medical supplies, the washing of thoses clothes and sheets. Just take the food. I don't how it cost, but just try to run some numbers : you feed one person two times per day, every day for n time they stay at the hospice, and then fold it by the monthly amount of people coming. And again, it is just the food. Then fold it to the number of houses : there were 610 of MoC houses at the time of her death, in 123 countries, run by 4000 nuns. Any enterprise of that size would naturally brass millions in operating costs, and they'd have profits - here, they rely only on the donations.

Then, why have people given money to them instead of a secular medical NGO? They simply did, because they wanted to and they believed in the project. Nowadays nuns are formed, and they run hospitals, but remember that what Saint Mother Theresa did, in the beginning, was only to give a decent place to die to people who were abandoned by everybody else, left to end on the street, as simple as that.

">  Not one cent of donated money should have gone to the church if it was donated under the assumption that it would help patients directly. 

I agree this is valid, but the problem here is that we don't know how the money is spent. Some accounts say it was used to build more charities and leper houses, others say that she donated most of it to the Vatican. The Vatican does run charitable organisations for medicine, but it is speculation to say that Teresa donated if she did expecting it to be spent for charity. My contention here is that her critics don't have any hard evidence that there was mismanaging,  although they could have reason for speculation. 

>And there is no excuse for failing to hire people with real medical training and endeavoring to provide real medical care when you have that much funding. 

Again, the doctors who visited Teresa, the critical ones, mention that the secular government-run hospitals in Calcutta were strained. How do we know that the problems in Calcutta were not merely that of the problems of third-world care, not just Teresa?

 Edit: I think there is a lack of perspective here on the varying quality of medical and sanitary care in India through time and place. For example, my place, Kerala is well to do while places in North India lack basic sanitary facilities like toilets. The very nature of India makes medical care divided by caste/ class/ geography much more than Western societies.",badhistory

A good question, yes. My question again is, if there is mismanagement of the money, there should be at least some hard evidence on this. You're still giving speculations.

>Chatterjee stated that after she died that both hygiene and quality of care improved, as well as nurse training.

This just sounds to me like a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy. Is it merely because of Mother Teresa's death? What is the implication here, that Teresa's death freed them?

>Chatterjee is, as far as I can tell, left wing.

Chatterjee is/was a communist and communism and Bengal have a long history. Your original point was that ""Indians"" (not Chatterjee specifically) rose conversion issues. It is a well-known here that hard right-wing politics in India have always brought up Christian/ Islam conversion issues.

Also, Chatterjee is actually skeptical of the Teresa conversion stories in Calcutta, he points out the same Susan Shield story from Hitchens. IIRC he said that Teresa would not do it in Calcutta fearing Hindu outrage and he gives her the benefit of the doubt on this.

>What is required to make one an expert in Mother Theresa?

Doing original research in an academic setting by relevant experts. The Montreal paper is not a new source if it rehashes old sources.

>I implore you to look at the other sources cited. There are DOZENS. Not all are negative. Quite a few are not, in fact.

I have and they mention only 5 critical works. Just because they used a dozen sources doesn't mean they used them equally. Their methodology favoured critical works. They said of the mostly positive writings on Teresa as that \[translated from French\] *""such unanimity, where there is no doubt, seemed suspicious to us. In this context, Orwell's (1949) suggestion to the effect that “the saints should always be considered guilty until proven otherwise ”(p. 85) appeared relevant to us""*.

From Jupiter's moons, to the surface of the moon, to the phases of Venus, to the sunspots (a controversy was sparked with Simon Scheiner about who first discovered and explained this, \[*it was Galileo's explanation that was correct*\], and that infuriated him). Galileo was wrong about the Earth's tides, though. But even though he was wrong, there was something cynical going on that was entrapping him, which I will answer for the following statement: 

> **He also tried himself in interpreting the bible as a lay person at a point in time in which the church wasn't at a good place.** 

This is wrong, because it assumes something about Galileo (that he wanted to interpret the Bible) that is wrong.

First, it is not Galileo's fault that the troubles leading to the 30 years' war happened (call me a hater if I said the Church had it coming, but that's beside the point anyway). Galileo never pretended to be a theologian or a master of exegesis. In fact, in most of his correspondence before the trial, and even in his famous *Dialogue*, he avoided tackling the religious arguments (when *Simplicio*, a devout Aristotelian, used religious arguments in the *Dialogue*, *Salviati*, Galileo's alter-ego, didn't want to go there). 

In 1613, Galileo communicated on a private level with Bellarmino (who was an old student and colleague at Pisa University) about the interpretation of the Bible in light of Copernicus' work, when the latter was prompted by the duchess of Lorraine to confirm to her the orthodoxy of the theory. Galileo merely helped Bellarmino and wrote to him that when it comes to physical phenomena, Scripture had no jurisdiction (that's not someone who wanted to interpret the Bible).

But when religion became publicly involved in a question about natural philosophy (*i.e. what does it mean, theologically, that the Earth revolved around the Sun?*), critics, especially the biblical literalists, starting going about biblical verses that firmly defended geocentrism, like Joshua's famous Sun stopping myth. Even the natural philosophers who were supposed to tackle the issue from a non-theological point of view, started using religious arguments (Tycho Brahe himself did). Galileo was confronted with a dilemma: the more he attacked Aristotelianism, the more the geocentrists attacked him using religious arguments, and the rumors spread about his true beliefs. This is what happened with the phases of Venus: when he mentioned Jupiter's moons and the surface of the Moon, those who at least listened threw his arguments by stating that none of that proved heliocentrism. But the argument of the phases of the Venus was one of the most spectacular moments in all of science: having two theories compete, each with its predictions, and seeing which one fit the observations. The phases of Venus couldn't be fitted in Ptolemy's system without adding ugly math that Aristotelians themselves didn't like. But, as Galileo learned the hard way, the Aristotelians always shifted the goalposts, by putting the burden on their opponents to prove against what they can't themselves prove for. Tycho Brahe, who liked Copernicus' work and taught it in Denmark, and who had arguments against some Aristotelian physics, still thought the latter to be foundational. His bias to the old physics prompted him (in good faith) to propose a modification to Ptolemy's system, called the Tychonic system, where the planets orbited the Sun, which itself orbited the Earth. This way, the argument of the phases of Venus would be useless, and Aristotelianism survives. It is important to note that, using the physics of the time, the Tychonic and heliocentric systems were equivalent, and it's only a matter of perspective (it would take years and different theories to be able to distinguish the apparent equivalence that can be understood in light of Galilean relativity at the time. A full understanding would be achieved with Einstein's special relativity). Tycho was almost convinced by Copernicus' system, but he couldn't conceive how something as massive as the Earth could move (almost like early creationists who were curious to learn Darwin's work, but dismissed it because they couldn't conceive how his theory could explain all the design in nature). Tycho's work became massively popular, especially among the Aristotelians, who, instead of thanking Galileo and the Copernicans for prompting such modifications, used the new system to attack Galileo again, by shifting the goalposts now to the newly observed comets, and the moveability of the Earth. And behind this seemingly scientific exchange, there were accusations, particularly from literalists, who wanted to portray Galileo as a heretic. Even some of the Jesuits (who some historians like to portray as helpers who were backstabbed by Galileo), attacked him. Orazio Grassi, a Jesuit, attacked Galileo in a publication (one under his name which discussed scientific matters, and one under a pseudonym to attack Galileo's religious beliefs during a time when the church's counter-reformation had deep interest to limit the mess of the 30 years' war). Barberini (still not yet pope Urban) gave Galileo the green light to respond, and he did in *Il Saggiatore*. As was the custom during the time, the Inquisition didn't start investigation by its own, or at least rarely. Most often, they were tipped. And it was Grassi that tipped them to investigate Galileo about his Catholic faith (there would be no trial after initial investigation).

Some people will say that Galileo was rightly challenged about his refutation of Aristotelian physics, and they're half right. That's because Galileo wasn't simply challenged scientifically, but in other aspects that attacked his person and his beliefs (because these people were insecure in theirs). Whenever Galileo talked about Scripture (which he did in a serious letter, I forgot who received it), he gave his own opinion to fend the accusations of heresy (sometimes it was obvious that he tried too much, suggesting that he was seriously annoyed by these accusations). When things involved Aristotle's physics, he didn't shy away from responding, but he had to tiptoe around religion, as he was well aware of the troubling times. In the rare occasions he explicitly talked about difference between science and religion, he never claimed to be a theologian and interpreted things for people. 

>  The clergy was annoyed but the Pope protected him from any repercussions 

Urban VIII had much more serious problems to deal with during the war than Galileo. Yes, most Dominicans, a good deal of Jesuits (don't know about other groups), who were mostly Aristotelian because of Aquinas, erroneously linked themselves to all the geocentrists, and felt attacked. They were pissed, and I think I have listed a couple of times when they were more than just angry. 

> Now, what set of his trial was that the Pope commissioned a book talking  about the advantages and disadvantages of both heliocentricism and  geocentricism in a neutral tone. Galileo took this opportunity and made a  strawman of the Pope's arguments and made him look like an idiot in an  academic book. 

Now this one is just made up, and I think I know why.

First of all, it doesn't make sense that Urban VIII commissioned a book about the *Dialogue* in 1624, as it is claimed, and the book appearing 8 years later, a book that was written for Galileo's patron, Ferdinando de' Medici, who received the first copy of the book on 21st of February, 1632. And if the Pope did receive a copy during this time and was shocked as it is wrongly claimed, there is no explanation for why the summation of Galileo by the Holy Office waited 7 months. I looked at different books (some lousy books I found!) who mention this, and I have not found a primary source for Urban VIII's demand. And I don't think there is one. The reason why it is made up is because there are only conjectures as to why Urban VIII agreed to go along with Galileo's punishment (most archives about the Inquisition are lost and only some survive for Galileo's affair, making it difficult to have a thorough understanding of how the Roman Inquisition worked). So, to give an ""apology"" for the Pope, this little story is conceived. You will find it pretty common among Jesuits, because Urban VIII was taught by Jesuits.",badhistory
"This turned out to be a long response, and I forgot that I wrote this much. I wrote it from memory, and based on a timeline that I usually keep for certain events. I hope it would be useful. I split it into three successive comments.

&#x200B;

>**Galileo was under the patronage of the Pope, who liked his work.**

No, Galileo's patrons were the Medicis. Cosimo II de' Medici was his long time patron and helped Galileo (by means of friends of Galileo's) get out of his financial troubles. When Cosimo suddenly died in 1621, Ferdinando II became his patron, and they were close because Ferdinando liked his astronomical work. For most of his life, Galileo communicated with the future pope Urban VIII when the latter was still the cardinal Maffeo Barberini. And yes, it is true. Barberini liked Galileo and liked his work, even though he didn't agree with everything. Once Urbain VIII, the Pope had less and less interaction with Galileo.

>**He previously unsuccessfully argued for the heliocentric system, because  his circular orbits didn't improve the predictability of the planets  and stars.**

This is wrong. This is not Galileo, but Copernicus. Long before his book became posthumously known, Copernicus was conscious about the problems of his heliocentric system. It's most likely why he didn't publish it: because he was afraid that he wouldn't rise to the challenge of the traditionalist natural philosophers, most of them very dogmatic. Natural philosophers at the time were heavily influenced by Aquinas' merging of theology and Aristotelian physics. It is therefore evident why the Ptolemaic system was adopted and cherished. But, before 1616, it was just that, a subject natural philosophy. It wasn't a doctrine to be defended against heretics. And the mistake was making it a heresy in the first place.

What is usually missing in this picture, something that even some historians miss when jumping immediately to the trial (some do it deliberately), yet it is something profoundly important to Galileo, is his deal with Aristotelian physics. It's crucial to understand this about Galileo. Far before learning about the heliocentric system (in fact, since he was still 19 years old), Galileo liked the works of Pythagoras and Archimedes, but disliked Aristotelian physics. In fact, Galileo tried to dismantle this physics (in favor of what would be known as Mechanics, something he would be a pioneer of) more than he tried to prove heliocentrism. And it seems obvious, at least to me, that Galileo liked heliocentrism, mainly because it flew in the face of Aristotelianism. Before arguing that any of his discoveries defended heliocentrism, he argued that they contradicted Aristotle (and they did).

Copernicus had introduced epicycles, just like Ptolemy, because the observations didn't match the model. The issue was exactly due to Aristotle's physics: *the circle is the most perfect shape and had to describe the orbits of the supralunar perfect ""heavens""*. No one saw the wrong picture in this. Not even Tycho Brahe, the man with the best tools at the time. Not even Kepler. In fact, when Kepler set a mission to solve the problem in a couple of days, it took him years to investigate Brahe's minute observations before he could identify the problem: they're not circles, they're ellipses. This is one of those cases, if not the first, where scientists dogmatically hold onto something by pure tradition, without evidence, and demand that others provide evidence to the contrary (just like the issues with the phlogiston and the aether).

Galileo, of course, didn't see the issue as well, but he was on the right track. His hope to dismantle Aristotelianism lead him to revolutionary discoveries and theories, and he could have continued to reach more if he didn't feel he was being stifled and threatened. Kepler, on the other hand, was still hesitant about the status quo (Here, I am not trying to diminish Kepler. He was right about the tides when Galileo was not).

Galileo was aware, like anyone else, that Copernicus' system was flawed. Yet he saw in it the simplicity and beauty that would help him attack Aristotelian physics. It's a really long story. And before we can talk about the trial, in fact before we can talk about how religion became involved (in 1612), it's important to know what happened since 1610, when he published his first major work, *Sidereus Nuncius*. Before this, some plagiarized his work, which explains why he was so protective of his discoveries (some historians would anachronistically portray this is egotism, whereas it was a common attitude known as Renaissance individualism).

After *Sidereus Nuncius*, the Copernicans of course loved it. But this would trigger hate from most Dominicans, some Jesuits and, most importantly all the Aristotelian geocentrists. I can't give a full detail (maybe some other time), but the reaction to his work started with the geocentrists either missing the point, or just plain denying it. This book is very important, much more important than the *Dialogue* that caused all the fuss. It's beautiful, even with the errors that one wouldn't have detected at the time. Kepler was even impressed with it, and initiated a discussion about it. Galileo, becoming an astronomer rather than a mathematician, received honor after honor. Yet there were a group of people focused on ridiculing him, publishing pamphlets, initially about him denying Astrology, or Aristotle's work (who was at the time an authority on natural philosophy), some even wanted him to be kicked out of work in the university, or tried to remove his pension, or stir troubles with his patrons, and at the end of 1612, religion became involved (this was before the 30 years' war). Some friends warned him about this. Galileo started noticing how dogmatically Aristotelianism was being held, and the more evidence he offered against it, the more the Aristotelians offered little tweaks instead of having a serious conversation about the old physics. There is a lot of things that happened. Some people were keen on destroying Galileo's career. Some, like Foscarini, tried to defend him using a twisted version of the Copernicus' system (and since Galileo became the face of Copernicus' defense, he was unfairly linked to these people). Some people wanted to have a serious conversation, but they knew that Copernicus would lead them to deal with troubling ""wisdom"", especially with people like Foscarini spreading falsehoods (Galileo talked to his friend Sagredo about these people in one his correspondence letters).",badhistory

And essentially, any maker of a theory is doing this to some extent- how else can people so often come to opposing 'rational' conclusions. If he has misquoted his context, that's not necessarily a problem, unless he is claiming to put forward Aquinas as sharing his meaning. Eg if I was to say ""Aquinas says 'beware the person of one book', and this quote helps illustrate how I'm wary of friends who only have one book in their rucksack, because they'd have less ammunition in an impromptu game of book dodgeball"", then I'm using his out of context quote to explain my own point.

"The point is that opium was regulated well beforehand. (Though it was a bit leaky and even today illicit use of opium is known). Registered opium consumers were being sold opium from government depots.

See the 1966 UN reference, which clearly states that the government had the legal monopoly since 1773 and the state of administration in 1966

> The Central Agency which administers the Narcotics Laws is the Narcotics Commissioner to the Government of India under the overall control of the Ministry of Finance (Department of Revenue). The Narcotics Commissioneris assisted by the Deputy Narcotics Commissioner at Ghazipur and Assistant Narcotics Commissioners at Neemuch, Kota and Lucknow. These charges are again sub-divided into what are known as "" Divisions "" and each division is headed by an officer called the "" District Opium Officer "". The charge of a District Opium Officer is so formed that with the assistance of the staff under him he can effectively exercise control over poppy cultivation right from the time the seed is sown till the opium is collected from the cultivators and sent to the factories.

With a view to taking stock of the situation, and to devising further ways and means in this direction, two more All-India Narcotics Conferences were held in 1956 and 1959 which inter-alia reiterated the decisions of the 1949 Conference. As a result of the above decisions, oral consumption of opium for non-medical purposes has since been prohibited throughout the country with effect from 1st April 1959,


What happened in 1959 was stopping fresh registration of opium users - which does not require a new law.

> oral consumption of opium for non- medical purposes was prohibited throughout the country and fresh registration of opium users was stopped from June 1959

eg current discussion on decriminalization of cannabis in the US often focuses on executive action at the federal level by moving it from schedule I to schedule II or III. 

ie Your logic has a big blind spot related to executive action.

> that can be attributed to the 1985 act

The 1985 law permits medical and scientific use, so the challenges are not necesserily in the law itself, but to government attitudes and policies associated with transaction and control that bled over to/impacted medicine. ie. executive action and softer factors

I mean, there is evidence, but you've rejected it out of hand.

The implication is that Mother Teresa was either incompetent or malicious, but in either case made herself the center of most decisions regarding care, and that upon her death those conditions improved. The additional implication also being though that a greater portion of the money coming in was actually being spent appropriately on care.

It concluded that ""Chatterjee's book, undermined by contradictions, inconsistencies, and sloppily edited, is not it [a fully documented account of Mother Teresa's activities].

Yes, you're very stuck on this Irish Times review. I wish that you'd stop selectively quoting it to support your point though, because in so doing you're leaving out the good bits. Let's let it breathe without your edits:

>The book is full of misprints, appalling syntax, missing words, and repetition. The tone is one of heavy sarcasm, which only detracts from the important points which are there to be made. The first-hand testimony from people who worked in Mother Teresa's organisation, although mostly not new, is truly shocking. Of the famous house for the dying, we are told grossly inadequate pain relief is offered to the patients, that needles are unsterilised and re-used until blunt, that no visitors are allowed, and that people with treatable illnesses are not brought to hospital. There is mention of forced baptisms. It's a very long way from the principles of the hospice movement.
>In the orphanage, we are told, children are eight to a cot, handicapped children get no appropriate care, there is no running water because the sisters refuse to get an electric pump, there are no washing machines, bottles and spoons are shared, toilet facilities are appalling and unhygienic, and nutritionally inferior powdered milk is provided for infants. There is a deeply unpleasant ethos which exalts suffering as redemptive, even when the sufferer does not share this view. All of this is very serious, and deserves wide dissemination.

We're going to keep going in circles. Let me boil it down to this. We both agree that there are things culled from Hitchens' and Chatterjee's works that are simply overblown and misattributed and credited to Mother Teresa, when in fact it was the law at the time. We also both agree that Hitchens was grinding an atheist axe and was trying to paint Mother Teresa as some evil ideologue who wanted to make people suffer.

Where we differ is that you seem to think that because Mother Teresa meant well, that deserves credit. I believe that regardless of your intent, if people suffer due to your incompetence or your malice, that deserves scorn and derision.

We also cannot agree on what happened with the finances. You still give a much greater berth on benefit of the doubt, which is admirable, but I find to be naive. Millions of dollars are unaccounted for, and I have yet to see an instance of that occurring without something untoward happening. Maybe in this case, for the first time in human history, it's a genuine error. But I highly doubt it, especially considering Mother Teresa's willingness to associate with grifters and tyrants.

This made-up story also misrepresents *Dialogue*. This book, which was an exposé with a pinch of satirical work more than an actual academic book, presented the problematic character *Simplicio* as a dogmatic Aristotelian (the book is not just about the heliocentric system, as it is often assumed from limiting Galileo's story to heliocentrism). He was clearly modeled on the real-life people of *Lodovico delle Colombe* (a huge Aristotelian adversary, the leader of what Galileo's friends called the Pigeon League that focused on attacking him, and someone who used religion as well), and *Cesare Cremonini* (who refused to look through the telescope, hinted at when *Salviani* discusses how the Peripatetics, i.e. the Arestotelians, are like slaves to Aristotle, denying observations and refusing to look at the telescope). It is important to note that while *Simplicio* is dogmatic, he is not an idiot, only someone who's blinded by strict adherence to Aristotle. And someone who, instead of accepting an explanation, ignores it and moves to the next, as Galileo must have felt when talking to the defenders of Aristotle. The misrepresentation of this is behind the suggestion that the Pope identified himself through the character, for which there is no evidence (I would personally identify the Pope with *Sagredo*, based on Galileo's close friend Sagredo). The likely scenario is that the Aristotelians were offended by being shown to have no argument. Writings of this style aren't unique to Galileo. Whether the clergy was also offended or not, might be irrelevant here, since someone must have tipped Galileo to the Inquisition again, but this time the tipper knew what they were doing: in the past, they struggled to attack Galileo on religious grounds, but now, since Copernicus' work and teachings were banned by decree, Galileo would be summoned by the Inquisition for a serious aggravation. He was very sick at the time, and didn't go to Rome until 8 months later, when threats were sent to him in June, 21st. He went the next day. The accusations, clear as they were, were about him believing a false doctrine of the Sun being the center of the world, and for believing a doctrine that was deemed contrary to the Holy Scriptures (Copernicus' work). Galileo was found strongly suspected of heresy, that heresy being the belief in the false doctrine of the movement of the Earth and the stillness of the Sun, and was consequently forced to pronounce the adjuration. As for the Pope, he had much more troubles during the war, troubles with the Protestants that would obscure any nuance about Galileo's trial.

The outcome of Galileo is less important than the trial and what lead to it. Despite people feeling that there was some sort of  compromise (the Pope couldn't change the outcome of the verdict, but he did indeed have a final saying in how the punishment should work, and he choose house arrest for a very old man), the trial had shown the travesty of the Roman Inquisition and it trespassing its ""magisterium"" by meddling with what and how natural philosophers should think about things that were only loosely linked to the Doctrine of the Church. Galileo was treated badly by the Aristotelians, but he knew how to defend himself. The problem rose when one side brought religion to the issue, similar to how race was brought into the trial of OJ Simpson, and gained sympathy from people who were blinded by their zeal to fend off heresy. Descartes, who was finishing his now not-so-famous work *Traité du monde et de la lumière* (The World), was troubled by Galileo's trial (as were others in Germany and the Netherlands). He didn't publish it. Instead, he published another book, the now famous *Discours sur la méthode*, in which he mentions the *Traité* (which would be published posthumously), in 1637. It would be added to the Index in 1662.",badhistory

Keeping the context of the state of medical care in India at mind and that she wasn't interested in running a hospital, I do feel it's unfair to stress on it when she never claimed that's what her mission was, which was a traditional hospice. They could have spearheaded improvements in medical care yes, but keeping both those things in mind, I genuinely think they lacked incentive and made a decision for better or worse.

">I think this is the most divisive part of MT. Her mission wasn't to provide medical care to the poor.

Sure, but I don't think (as you seem to) that this means that we necessarily should be judging her based on her own criteria.

We see this same problem in the case I cited above, where she sent young nuns into a malaria zone without basic antimalarials. Sure, she could argue that ""her mission"" was only to provide spiritual care to these young people, not to take care of their physical safety. To me though, ethically speaking her organization still has a basic duty of care towards its workers, and the scope she herself gave her mission is unconscionably narrow because it put people in harm's way.

I see this same issue with her hospices. She seems to have chosen an overly narrow scope which leaves out things like her duty of care, but I think that is unethical and I won't judge anyone by standards as low as those she set herself.

People suffering from non-fatal illnesses certainly should not have been exposed to infectious diseases and given needles washed in lukewarm water. If refraining from doing those things was outside the scope of her mission then her choice of scope is in itself the problem, not a viable excuse.

I have really benefited from your perspective as an Indian on this and it does make me feel like this is a more complex issue than I had perhaps given it credit for. As a westerner who can remember appeals to donate money to her charity when she was alive, I can't help thinking that if she had been honest about her mission (""we are going to provide comfort, but we are also going to reuse unsterilized needles because we're not interested in that side of things"") she would have had far less money and perhaps a more medically-inclined charity would have stepped into the breach.

Reducing illicit diversion obviously means less cultivation would be enough for legal supply. Are you claiming that there was a shortage of legal opium?

If the law is about distribution, it does not automatically apply to sale. That's not flexibility of law, that's abuse.

"**As I said, I believe that what fundamentally separates Teresa's critics from her admirers is their different philosophical approaches to the poor.** I understand that you believe proper care should also account for improving medical standards (*and I agree with you, to an extent; as a medical professional, if I was placed in Mother Teresa's shoes I would have tried my best to improve them*). Teresa's approach to poverty was something of extreme empathy; I don't think she was out to address its causes and rectify it, but to provide comfort and solidarity with the poor. *To keep solidarity with the poor, she had a vow to abstain from the presence of luxury as much as possible.* This luxury was not restricted to medicine; the charity abstained from third-world luxuries that would be first-world essentials: stairs instead of elevators, washing by hand instead of washing machines; *even simple things like pencils were used instead of pens to help reuse paper*.  I speculate that if there was something that was feasible to do without subscribing to modernity, even if difficult, she defined it as luxury. Would it have been more efficient if she accepted modernity as a tool to help the poor? Strictly yes, but that didn't address the core of her mission. *To understand the poor, we have to be like the poor.* (Side-note, as an Indian, this philosophy is drilled into our heads as positive by our textbooks using figures like Gandhi and Teresa, so maybe that's why I'm sympathetic to this view).

This is also a point where her religion would cause a divide. From a naturalistic (and hedonistic) perspective, all suffering is pointless and measures should be made to maximise pleasure and minimise suffering. *For a Catholic, there are more fundamental issues to address than material suffering.* They believe that suffering also hurts your spirit and dignity by separating the person from God. Suffering to them cannot simply be alleviated by addressing it's physical components. To that extent, she believed that people can be happy without luxuries. Her philosophy was that there is beauty in the poor which (to me) is equally admirable and naive.

*Would she have done a much better job actually rectifying the core issues of poverty in Calcutta? In a very strict sense, yes.* Was it within her scope? It's not entirely clear. Bengal was rife with political and social issues and it isn't a problem that could have been solved by throwing money at it. It's definitely not Teresa's sole responsibility to improve the standards back then, that is the fault of Bengal's shoddy administration. *She administered hospice care to her inmates which was similar to the general standards of India at the time and (my speculation) her vow to abstain from luxuries probably prevented her from looking at, from her perspective, richer ways that help the poor that do not empathize with them but alienate them from their self.* This perspective restricted her from empowering the poor using modernity.

**What to me is undeniable is that Mother Teresa did ""something good"" for the poor.** I am not qualified to measure the worth of another. She undeniably inspired people with her charity, people who may have done better work than her. Teresa's mythos changed the average Bengali's attitudes towards the poor. **Robin Fox (the same critical doctor) says it as such,** ""*The fact that people seldom die on the street is largely thanks to the work of Mother Theresa and her mission. The citizens have been sensitised by her work over the past 40 years; and, where formerly they tended to avert their eyes, now they are likely to call an ambulance. And, if the hospitals refuse admission, Mother Theresa’s Home for the Dying will provide.""*

Critics like Hitchens paint her with a single stroke; a thieving Albanian nun who found pleasure in suffering and that is a terrible analysis. **We can criticize Mother Teresa's care from a medical perspective, but what I fundamentally disagree with Hitchens is that it arose out of malice and I believe you agree with me there.** From a secular view, its a misplaced notion of how to deal with suffering, but I fail to see the malice.

**This is another good perspective from a Bengali who is ambivalent about Mother Teresa's image:**  [**https://thewire.in/religion/mother-teresa-up-close-and-personal**](https://thewire.in/religion/mother-teresa-up-close-and-personal)

Science supports this conclusion more every year. We keep finding that morality is not unique to humans. Non-human animals have a sense of fairness and justice. 

For example, if you train crows to spend tokens to buy food, and one day give one crow no tokens but another multiple tokens, the latter crow will notice and will give tokens to the crow who recieved none so it can eat, too.

We've seen cases of dogs and cats risking their lives to save humans. We've seen apes like orangutans rush to help pull a human out of a river after they've fallen in. We've seen even small monkeys tantrum when they see their peers receive food while they do not, but not when *all* of them don't receive food.

We could go on and on. Every year we have more proof that morality is evolved rather than imparted to us by a God.

But this debate is far older than Hitchens. If you ever take an introductory philosophy course you'll learn about [the Problem of Evil.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil) Which claims that there's a paradox in believing in an all-knowing, ever-present, all-powerful being who is benevolent but also allows unspeakable evils all the time.

You'll also read numerous tangents to this debate and the takes of many great thinkers. My favorite is probably Arthur Schopenhauer's take [here.](https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/On_the_Sufferings_of_the_World)

He raises the point that the terror that prey feels as it keeps an eye out for predators, then flees from one, then falls as the predator's teeth and claws tear its body apart, is significantly greater than the satisfaction the predator feels from a successful chase and meal.

Imagine living every day on edge, ready to sprint at the sound of a snapping twig. Imagine a tiger or bear or pack of wolves, all much bigger than you, chasing you with intent to murder. Imagine feeling the sting of a fang or claw in your leg and knowing that any damage done is going to make it much harder to escape.

 Imagine slowing down from it, faltering, tripping, lying on the ground gasping for air as the predator lunges for your throat or your belly or, as lions prefer to do, your groin. Imagine having chunks torn out of you. Over and over again you feel the fangs and claws dig through your flesh as the predator steals it to feed itself. Imagine looking down and seeing your intestines hanging out as the predator chews at one of your organs. 

You're going to bleed out. Without friends or family nearby. While your most hated enemy consumes you. Your entire existence has lead to that moment and now it's over.

For the predator, it was no different from a game of chase. The predator will do it all over again in a day or two, for the rest of its life. Just to survive.

The suffering of the prey is so vast that it cannot be compared to the contentment of the predator. But people claim that God made this? That God created a world where most animals spend their entire lives worrying about being run down and eaten?

Humans aren't exempt, either. Humans get killed every day by tigers and hippos and alligators and bears and other humans.

We could go on and on. Because philosophers and theologians have debated this for centuries.

The bottom line, and the point that Hitchens would emphasize, is that we have absolutely no evidence to suggest that a God exists, that God is good, or that morals come from a God, but we do know that morals exist, that the broad strokes are shared among cultures, and that we have evidence of morals being evolved as well as sound logic about why that may be the case.",badhistory

"> licit sale of medicinal opium

A hospice is not a hospital. I believe this has been stated before 
And I think OP even made a distinction between traditional hospices and modern ones today. While there was difficulty in separation of medical, quasi-medical and non-medical usage in case of opium eating, the attitude was different in opium smoking .[Ref](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1957-01-01_3_page002.html)

And the supply volume includes *all* legitimate supply and sales, including medical and registered addicts and others. Which is why I talked about the streets not overflowing with opium .

> Are you claiming that there was a shortage of legal opium?

Read the relevant links. They did the claiming, not me. 

Do some research of your own.

There's actually a lot more complexity which I haven't bothered to discuss, including shipment of vast quantities of opium to china in the 19th century, smuggling and price rise, the complexities of state level (as opposed to central) regulation and [extension](http://legislative.gov.in/sites/default/files/A1950-33.pdf), change in control drivers from revenue extraction towards reduced availability and complete suppression, the regulations on individual and assembly usage and possession, which was effected progressively by various state laws and especially  executive rules.

The point being that in the 1950s onwards, overall licit supply kept reducing and was hardly tended to ubiquituos availability for hospices (as opposed to medical) usage. 

In [Bengal](https://www.latestlaws.com/bare-acts/state-acts-rules/west-bengal-state-laws/bengal-opium-smoking-act-1932/), for example

So when OP says that other hospices etc did not provide high qualitypainkillers such as prepared opium in India, the supply,sale and possession and other regulation seem aligned. 

You've made statements which suggest that you believe the burden of proof lies on exculpation of MoC, when every single system of justice lays it on the other side. When Hitchens does not appear to have done any preparatory work or case on the general situation in India.  

Dr Fox, I believe has made the only significant useful study/examination of his in 1991, when he talked about the medical practices in place (or lack thereof) and the standard of care.  (there have been a few specific accounts in newspapers) However standard of care by western and many indian medical standards is not the same as standard of care by other indian hospice standards.  The question of what standard of care is due from a charitable hospice is a little knotty one, where absolutes may not be helpful.

And anyone who desires to condemn has the responsibility to bring in context, rather than bowdlerize it in an eagerness to accuse.


----

eg. Even in 1991 or earlier, sterilization of needles was fairly well known. Thus partial boiling was insufficient standard of care. Was it negligent ? likely IMHO, ( though you might need to check on circumstances behind training/ignorance, availability of medical personnelknowedge  and whether it was typical)  Does it rise to level of gross negligence (a medical standard for culpability , but not a hospice standard)? Don't know. Would it be grossly negligent if continued after Dr Fox advised of it. Hell, yes, IMHO.",badhistory

"Thank you for writing all this. It was very enjoyable to read. Now to be frank I'm completely unfamiliar with anything other than the broad strokes of St. Teresa or her charity. That's an interesting perspective form the Bengali, and to a certain extent I agree with her wish that her charities would use their resources, that are now much larger than they used to be, to give better medical care. On the other hand I can see the argument that the money would be better spent opening more hospices, orphanages, and the like.

 Personally I find the idea of using only warm and not boiling water to clean syringes are pretty unacceptable, and I have some major reservations about, at least what you think, St. Teresa's reasoning was. 

Ideally, the underlying issues of poverty and lack of resources would be addressed, but that's a huge undertaking that charities and nonprofits can help and do help with, but they shouldn't be leading and spearheading it (course this is part of my political opinion that part of a social contract/the government's job is to help address societal issues, especially because in America the money's there it's just not spent on that sort of thing so it's easy to say that while in a developing nation like India it's not as clear-cut). 

My real issue is that I can at least kind of understand her thought process there on living like the people they took care of and buried, but I think trying to give better medical care should've been a priority. Especially after she and her work became well-known, asking doctors to come on missions or sabbaticals to help give nurses basic medical care, as well as provide their own expertise if/when it could be used seems like an obvious thing to do, especially because if a lot of western doctors see widespread sub-standard facilities, staff, training, infrastructure, etc.  that was *not* exclusive to St. Teresa's hospices, then you potentially have all these doctors going home and saying ""we need to help build up India's medical infrastructure. Also, morphine is controlled waaay more than it ought to be \[i.e. so those laws'd be relaxed sooner than real life\]. For that matter, it's probably really bad in other developing and Third World nations, so let's help them too,"" though all that's just speculation and optimism on my part. 

Nevertheless, she undeniably did tremendous good and should be applauded for that. I just wish she'd been able to do more. I guess my real qualm (I've had to rewrite this several times BTW) I have is that I think modernity is as corrupting as we let it be, and something like modern medicine is not corrupting (outside of the U.S. but that's greedy and unchecked insurance and pharmaceutical companies corrupting it, not the new treatments that are more effective or safer or whatever), and that not welcoming it does the people you care for a disservice, especially since I don't quite fully buy the ""Must be like to understand"" idea. I do somewhat: that there are so many spoiled rich assholes who don't and, sadly, probably never will know about much less understand the plights of those in poverty proves this. But, and this might just be me fooling myself, I think that at least some people who spend enough time with and around poor people can do a good job of empathizing with and understanding them. Might not have walked a mile in their shoes, but as nuns those shoes were already pretty similar, and I don't think St. Teresa needed to work to make them more so.

How can you say that when throughout human history, many cultures practiced human sacrifice, others ritual cannibalism, others still justified the murder of civilians when a city is stormed under siege, all of which are vastly different from the moral values most in the Liberal West, including Hitchens, share? Another example would be marriage, a large number of cultures practised polygamy, others monogamy, others still primarily had arranged marriages or marriages between adults and prepubescent teenagers.

">They did the claiming, not me.

They claim there's a reduction in illicit diversion and a reduction in supply provided to addicts. Your notion that this leaves nothing to spare for hospices is based on the presumption that:

1. hospices or any other retail customer must have their opium supply specifically reserved/earmarked with the chemist, whose decision to sell would be gatekept by the government

2. during shortfalls, addicts are the highest priority.

None of my research indicates that medical opium was not something you could simply buy from a pharmacy. The 1930 act even makes a distinction between 

>medicinal opium, that is, opium which has undergone the processes necessary to adapt it for medicinal use in accordance with the requirements of the British Pharmacopoeia

(presumably refers to laudanum) as opposed to prepared opium supplied to addicts. The Bengal law you linked is also about the latter.

>when OP says that other hospices etc did not provide high quality painkillers such as ~~prepared~~ opium in India

Other hospices were not headed by someone from the west who was used to western standards of care. Everything you mentioned about needles - circumstances behind training/ignorance, availability of medical personnel knowledge and whether it was typical - applies to local hospices regarding medical opium. I hold MoC  to a different standard because it was headed by someone who ought to know better.

"Thanks! Honestly speaking, I am not of the opinion that Teresa was a saint or such, I have made that clear elsewhere.

I really find it hard to believe that everyone except a few contrarians and critics are too stupid to think that she helped the poor in her own way. 

>Personally I find the idea of using only warm and not boiling water to clean syringes are pretty unacceptable, and I have some major reservations about, at least what you think, St. Teresa's reasoning was. 

Actually, I have conversed with a nurse who volunteered there for sometime on the 80s and 90s. She told me that they were boiling the needles to sterilize them. And technically, Teresa wasn't in charge of the hospice, nurses were. So I am doubtful on the veracity of the allegation.

You imply that we don't practice ritual cannibalism but hundreds of millions of Christians take the Sacrament.

You imply that we don't murder civilians but many people who have been deployed will tell you otherwise, and our cops murder plenty of *our* civilians every year.

You made a big point about marriage, ignoring that marriage rates have been falling in the West and that the rise of hookup culture and dating apps, that statistically see most women focusing most of their attention on just the top 20% of men, shows us how close we still are to our polygynous ancestors.

"There is no real evidence of God existing because God is supernatural and thus necessarily beyond our ability to measure and quantify. There are arguments for God's existence but they are all based on logic rather than evidence, because Occam's Razor allows us to dismiss any insertion of God into any consideration of physical evidence. Because any phenomena that can be explained by God magickally existing and magicking it into existence can also be explained by the simpler claim that the phenomenon magicked itself into existence without a God.

>we do know that morals exist, but they are based in nothing,

We have compelling evidence that morals are based on evolution. Prosocial behaviors often benefit the species as well as the individual. You're more likely to pass on genes if you cultivate a community that helps its membets survive hard times and mishaps.

>the fact that people generally have somewhat similar morals between cultures (though not as similar as you might think) is evidence for the existance of God not against it

Again, Occam's Razor allows us to dismiss this. We have evidence of recent shared guman ancestry and culture prior to the diaspora that saw humans fan out all over the globe, and we find similar reasons for things like the Golden Rule in most cultures. We have no reason to insert baseless, unfalsifiable supernatural explanations for why this is the case. 

>that isn't a reason to be moral, the opposite. Any individual who believes that is only moral when it benefits them, survival of the fittest etc.

On the contrary, if morality is evolved it is largely intrinsic and beyond much of our control, and what we can control we can surmise that we should choose to be moral because these morals wouldn't exist if they didn't benefit us and our communities. 

Who is more evolutionarily ""fit"" to you? The selfish loner or the tight-knit community that watches eachother's backs and takes care of its needy?

What's more is there is a very sound claim to be made that if your morals are based on the superstitious notion that God is watching and judging you at all times, you're not being moral. You're being a hostage.

I think it was Penn Jillette who famously replied to the implication that if morals didn't come from God then nothing was stopping us from murdering and raping as much as we want by saying that he already *did* all the murdering and raping that he wanted to do: **0**.

>The problem of evil has never been a problem for me. It's basically a bunch of babies thinking they know better than God.

The problem is that it seems that most of us *do* know better. Rowe made the critique that immense evil and suffering happend all the time that couldn't possibly serve any greater plan. Who benefits from a nest of baby squirrels freezing to death? What benefit does a child killed by luekemia at age 3 gain from God giving them luekemia and subjecting them to a painful death before they ever gained the capacity to consider their role in God's plan or accept Jesus into their heart?

There are many, many examples of things that happen that serve no greater good, educate nobody, and otherwise play no role in the spiritual evolution of our species. Which is consistent with the secular view that humans are not special creations, but inconsistent with the theistic belief that God made the universe for us.

It just sounds like a copout for when more primitive cultures couldn't explain how anything worked. They just blamed God. And isn't it funny how so much of God's behavior and so many of his values match the local superstitions of iron age goat herders? Wouldn't a God be able to act in a way that those of us in the future couldn't poke holes in? Wouldn't a God that knows all, is all powerful, and exists beyond time and space be able to give us values that people just 2000 years later couldn't improve on?

In any case, I find it incredulous to believe we can just dismiss such fundamentally important practises such as when killing is moral or when marriage is acceptable and claim all of humankind follows some objective moral ruleset. If our ""fundamental morals"" can't agree whether police brutality or human sacrifice is moral, then why follow them? 

Similarly, our ""fundamental morals"" can't seem to agree on a lot of things such as if homosexuality is acceptable, when theft is justified, whether promiscuity should be shamed, how much deference should one pay to authority figures (if at all), etc. Ignoring the very real human diversity when it comes to morality is impossible in my view. This diversity means in my view that attempting to find an objective morality, whether it be through God, reason or science, is impossible. 

The diversity of human religions means no one religion could possibly claim to represent an objective truth. 

Science can only describe, not make a normative claim like whether murder is moral. Chimpanzees, non-Sapiens hominids and Homo Sapiens all engage in altruistic behaviour, social behaviour as well as murder, theft and rape. Science cannot prove which of these behaviours is moral, it can only describe their existence, since descriptive claims cannot be turned into normative ones (to do so would ignore the is/ought distinction). Similarly, reason can tell us whether any given action would lead us to our goal, but it can't say which goals are moral, those are determined by culture, feeling and emotion.",badhistory

Let me just give one example. Above you posted a video by the emotional guy which was supposed, but didn't explain what was going on (I assume he is famous in Australia, probably conservative? No idea myself). However, there was an explanation, repeated several times: Pell is in the right because the other child died before he could say he was raped.

There are so many things left out of context which makes questionable choices look worse in hindsight.

"I get your point and in many cases would be inclined to agree, and I do feel like the main barrier to using science to evaluate morality is the subjectivity of end goals, as you suggest.

However, I believe that some goals do approach universality so closely that science *is* justified in asserting that ""human flourishing"" is a logical universal goal. And it's very possible to evaluate beliefs and actions based on their impact on individual health, happiness, and wellbeing, as well as that of an individual's family and friends, greater clan, community, city, state, nation, species, biosphere, etc.

I think that it makes more sense to look at morality as a gradient rather than as a binary system, with individuals falling at various places on the gradient based on various contexts, like time, place, circumstance, etc.

So, I'm inclined to think that any claim that science can't answer these questions is based on an artificially constrained view of morality and and a handicapped definition of ""science.""

&#x200B;

As a thought experiment, we can imagine one person driving a knife into the heart of another. Is this moral? Depends on the context.

In absence of all other factors? It's probably immoral. Because a life is being extinguished. Why is it immoral for a life to be extinguished? Because two lives can interact and propagate in ways that are greater than the sum of the two lives individually. 

Two people can reproduce and have kids. Two individuals can combine their knowledge and gain new insights. Two individuals can work together to accomplish physical tasks neither could accomplish on their own. Through the eyes of one another, each individual can know themselves better than if they were alone. etc etc.

But why is this propagation desirable or moral? Why would it be immoral to prevent them? I would say that there are many answers to these questions. One would be that life exists to propagate itself. Without it, there would be nothing. Very few moral systems prize nothingness over existence. Nothingness precludes any and all other positive moral developments.

Every moral question considered in a scientific framework will tend to regress to the consideration that the universe is 99.9999% void of life and likely has no true morals, so I feel like it's safe to cut that regression off at the boundary of Earth's biosphere and base morals on the idea that as sentient members of Earth's biosphere, we have a duty to care for it, to sustain it, and to help it propagate in a safe and balanced way.

Which sometimes makes driving a knife into someone else's heart a moral choice. For example, if they're trying to kill you.

"It's just a manner of saying. Tax slabs should be raised gradually. Then you don't forgo anything because income levels rise faster. But this government chose to keep the same tax rates for years and then suddenly make a drastic change. So they're not forgoing anything, they just extracted extra in the last few years.

This is the first time in 7 years where my effective tax rate would be similar to or slightly lower than last year. It has been consistently increasing. This year my effective tax rate reached close to 23%.",IndiaInvestments

"Loans or any other deductions like LTA, Medical expenses and most important HRA.",IndiaInvestments
"Yes lol, my CA adviced me to go to new regime 2 years ago since I didnt have many rebate options  
Now I'm even more happy with the new slabs, finally something good this year",IndiaInvestments
Govt is forgetting the most important thing - most salaried employees either live on rent or have a house loan. So HRA and home loans should be very important part of the deductions.,IndiaInvestments
Does this mean that someone with 11.9 lakh has more net salary than someone with 12.1 lakh 🤔,IndiaInvestments
"Example:

Income 11L - tax = 0 because of rebate

Income 12L - tax = 0 because of rebate

Income 13L - tax = 5% on 4-8Lakhs + 10% on 8-12lakhs + 15% on the last 1 lakh above 12lakhs",IndiaInvestments

Marginal relief will come into play almost certainly. It has been the case for previous regimes also.,IndiaInvestments
"Wait, so if I earn marginally more than 12L, won’t that make my in-hand salary effectively less than with salary of exactly 12L?",IndiaInvestments
Yes. Now I estimate that the possible deductions have to be > 6 lac for old tax regime to make sens,IndiaInvestments
Yeah same. Old one was around 70k more tax for me iirc.,IndiaInvestments

I have a 16lpa job and a 20L student loan. So I'm assuming old tax regime only should be continued for the next few years right?,IndiaInvestments
Can you expand on how this works?,IndiaInvestments
There will be marginal relief most likely. They just need to pay the part above 12L. Like how it's currently for 7L,IndiaInvestments

Maybe someone who earns 16LPA and spends 8LPA on rent in Mumbai and maxes out their 80D and 80C? But yeah it's rare,IndiaInvestments
Yeah. But 13L is not worse off than 12L as implied originally. And this would be the case no matter where this line is 7L or 12L or 50L (surcharge) and the line has to be there somewhere,IndiaInvestments

So would you recommend the BookMyForex over the 0 forex cards despite their conversion markup?,CreditCardsIndia
"BookMyForex is not trust worthy. They have 2 Forex cards. ""Single Currency Forex card"" which has low charges with no ATM withdrawal fee. And ""Multi-currency Forex Card"" which has quite high charges like 2% transaction amount ATM withdrawal fee. ""Single Currency Forex card"" serves purpose for most use cases.

But, the website is designed such that you end up selecting ""Multi-currency Forex Card"" by default. It takes conscious effort to select ""Single Currency Forex card"". However, once this is selected, the description internally still is generic like ""Forex card"". Even though they claim there is no joining fee, they will extract Rs. 250 in the name of delivery charges.

Finally, what gets delivered at home is ""Multi-currency Forex Card"" and you can't do anything now as you have already paid the delivery charges. And you realize that ""Single Currency Forex card"" is just a bait to make you buy a high charge card and you should have gone with more reliable brands.

On lighter note, the website is quite funny and designed by ingenious developers. When trying to raise complaint online, the dialog box asks for Order number. When you enter order number it says ""Wrong IFSC code"". When you enter some random valid IFSC code, it errors out saying wrong Order number.

"So Forex is Foreign Transaction charge which is usually levied on all foreign transactions done by our Indian cards. For most credit cards, it is roughly 3 to 3.5 percent. So basically every time you pay let's say 100 Euro, that's roughly 9000 inr and you will be charged 3.5% = 315 Inr

It is just silly extra charge and a lot of travel centric cards offer zero forex markup. If you are travelling abroad and spending via card, you can easily waste 5k+ in your trip.

And also, for the margin they cut, I didn't face it with BookMyForex at all. Could be happening with bank issued cards. For me it was straighforward. I see the exact exchange rate. I load the amount in Euros. I pay the exact same amount in INR plus some GST (40-50 rupees). And every transaction done from there on is purely in Euros. No extra deduction, nothing.

"1. Bookmyforex is prepaid card whereas Fi and Niyo are bank account debit cards. Currency rate differ from platform to platform. For BMF I can load one time and that money stays. Lets say I loaded 100 euros at 90 inr price, then I pay 9000+45 gst and then I can easily spend those 100 euros without worrying about fluctuations. Whereas if you withdraw using Fi Niyo or use any other credit card, the rate is applied at that transaction date or time rate. So it will keep varying. I found that my friend who was using credit card was paying slightly higher because or these fluctuating rates

2. Fi and Niyo are bank accounts. Fund reflect immediately depending on payment method. It's as if transferring money from one account to another.

3. BMF is not a debit card. You can use it to pay at Pos and you pay in Euros directly. So no extra charges apart from loading

4. Cash was rarely used. Almost everywhere I could use credit cards. Hardly used like 100 euros in entire trip

5. Yes. Any credit card and debit cards like Fi and Niyo attracts lots of hidden charges. I withdraw money from an Atm and it charged me extra for Atm fees apart from the 100 inr fees. Same with credit card, forex charges are applied and conversion rates vary. Hence BMF is least hassle because once you load, all your spends are in euros.",CreditCardsIndia

I agree that both are great, in fact 0% Forex charge credit card is ideal. But in case if you don't get it, Prepaid cards are to the rescue. 

Few benefits of Forex Prepaid cards

- There is no long process and approvals required to get one. No credit check etc  
- It gives even better idea of how much you are spending as you are conscious of loading money  
- I found them to be overall cheapest as the exchange rates are live and usually less. It might not be a lot of difference at the end of the day but certainly give you relief that bank is not looting you with background charges or higher conversion rate",CreditCardsIndia
Forex cards are great until they’re not. A few years ago the card numbers were stolen in the middle of the vacation with unauthorized charges. Had to cancel and use my debit card for the rest of the trip and never got the money back from the charges either. With cc atleast it’s insured.,CreditCardsIndia
"The exchange rate is based on Orient Exchange site, not their partners. Be mindful of charges like reloading fee and delivery fee for card, but they are very reasonable, i think 50rs +gst as i can recall.

Forex cards, especially the ones you mentioned with zero fees, are definitely cheaper than credit cards. Some of the reasons I don't use prepaid forex cards are that it doesn't have any rewards, I'd have to settle all payments before or during the trip rather than after the trip is complete, and I'm not really sure on its liability or how you'd go about filing disputes with forex cards if ever required.

"Aside from all the substantial policy and diplomatic outcomes that have been reached, esp the grand economic corridor which deserves it's own post, there's also a lot that managed to achieve in terms of perceptions and PR.

1) Joint statement by 3 of the BRICS founding countries, along with US and World Bank. All the countries involved are going to host the G20 in the next few years, so the statement highlights the shared commitment to take forward the momentum on reforming MDB's like World Bank and unlock 200 Billion Dollars in financing for developing world. 

This actually pretty big signalling to China and BRICS, signalling that BRICS is not the only game in town and it is def not an ""anti-west alliance"", and c clear rebuff to the notion that BRICS countries will step away from the Western Financial System

2)Handshake between Modi-Biden-MBS after the announcement of the Economic corridor. Pretty important picture after the recent coldness in Saudi-US ties and the closeness of Saudis with China

3) Selfie and meeting between Biden and Sheikh Hasina and her daughter. Again, pretty important optics after the recent coldness of ties between Bangladesh and US. There have been news reports that India has conveyed to US in back-channel talks that supporting the radical islamist opposition to Hasina in the name of ""values"" would be a shortsighted move. Bangladesh has come to the G20 at India's invitation

4) All the cultural flex shown by India, from explaining and showcasing symbols of Indian heritage like Konark Chakra, Nalanda University and Natraja to a very exhaustive cultural exhibition held involving artefacts from multiple Indian museums. 

5) On a lighter note, plenty of meme material has been provided with the interactions between Modi and UK PM Sunak and Italy PM Meloni

You should read the hole sentence, not just the part you like to comment. I never said 50 years is long time ago. I just stated that this war was long before i and a lot of other people lived.
And of course it was not necessary to kill civilians. But ukraine is a country which just want to get rid of all this sowjet bullshit… like the baltics, georgia,… 
Russia just invent some reasons to invade ukraine. But the real reason is and was to expand their territory. Russia comes to stay, not to liberate.

"I've said this multiple times, but I get shouted down. Regardless UPI is utter shite, it's obviously worse for NRIs, where we can't get it working.


People are so braindead and brainwashed into singing praises of UPI, that it's unreal. So let me spell it out, there is nothing unique or special in UPI, digital payments and contactless payments have existed for decades. The only thing unique about UPI is that it's free. There is no fee for the merchant to accept payments, this is the only reason UPI is popular.


The reality of life is that nothing is free, so tax payers are subsidizing merchants by paying for their transaction costs.


But even putting that aside, the UPI protocol is extremely poorly designed, the fundamental problem is that it is tied to SIM based authentication, that's the only thing it supports, the one and only thing (The rest of the world acknowledges that phone swapping, SIM skimming make this a rather insecure mechanism, but nope, not India).


Even if you put that aside a UPI client application needs full access to your phone calls, text messages, your location and camera/photos (to scan QR codes they say, but the access is unfettered). So basically for the privilege of making a payment, the government mandates that you surrender every shred of your privacy to private third party applications. Doesn't this sound like the most amazing idea?",nri
You are not the target demographic for using UPI.,nri
Well said.,nri
NRO accounts with an Indian number work well and I have been using mine for years. For using it abroad you would need a location spoofer.

4. Incoming SMS are free anywhere.   
5. Once we got to the US, we turned cellular data OFF, put the phone on our home wifi

Whenever an app or a website needs to send us an OTP, we get the incoming OTP on the Indian number but we don't get charged for it. Of course, we don't make outbound calls or send outbound SMS messages using the Indian number.

In addition to the above if you keep some cash topup, you can receive important calls or even call back India at nominal charges ( many countries are covered at INR2/min). 

This is the best solution and works flawlessly.

You can also have Jio postpaid INR 199+gst per month and not worry about additional top up for the rare incoming call receiving. You may have someone back in India who doesn't have WhatsApp and prefer to call your India number... Helps in all those cases.",nri

"I don't think there is a talent issue, it's more of bureaucrats making decisions when they're not really the experts. So misalignment of the talent is probably one part of the problem.

The other thing is that even if the first version of the protocol had this 1-1 mapping with the SIM, it could and probably can still be extended to support other identity verification sources. However instead of acknowledging this or working towards this, there is a marketing push which is telling everyone that UPI is now supported for non residents, a UPI kiosk is opened up in France when the PM visits. All this is gimmicky and we'd be better served if real improvements were made and prioritized.",nri

Yeah I've heard from people closer to the banking operations that dealing with UPI failed transactions is a pain for them. The overall percentages aren't high but due to the volume the absolute numbers are still high and this ends up being operational work at the branch level.,nri
"You need to understand UPI solves more than one problem. It is an excellent solution to the problem of peer-to-peer small payments in the Indian context. It is also an excellent solution to encourage the formerly un-banked poor to move into the formal economy and get off the dependence on cash for everything in their lives. 

UPI also promises one form of digital or cashless payments for merchant transactions. However, that is not a problem that was a big one even in India (credit / debit cards always worked) nor is it something to compare to solutions in other countries because credit / debit cards and other methods have worked ""seamlessly"" and extremely conveniently for decades in the US and elsewhere. 

Peer to peer, yes, I grant you, Zelle and such are not that good and suffer from the problem of lack of universal acceptance. But that just wasn't a big problem in the US. In fact even today we see players like Google entering and then leaving the market since they don't see much interest and demand for P2P currently. The US is market-driven. If there is a high demand for P2P, tomorrow someone will make Zelle or whatever available to solve it. In India it is driven top-down, the govt. decided everyone should use UPI, so they rolled it out and made it free to boot. Which approach is better gets into more philosophical matters. What we should focus on is whether the relevant problems for the people in each place have appropriate solutions or not.",nri
"you are glorifying UPI as tech less transaction and at the same time saying same type of transactions in other countries as backwards and problematic. Pick a side. 

India used to be 95% cash based transaction country. Now it has moved to non cash based system for majority of the part. Other countries have been cashless for more than 20 years. India is catching up. It’s is big achievement given the population and adoption rate within short period of time(covid, Govt subsidiecing the transaction cost, demonetization helped this movement a lot). But it is not something that is being done first time. And this is not inclusive as OP explained.",nri

IMPS came in 2010. There were few other smaller schemes too. Even bitcoin launched in 2009 if you count that. 

Point is, no need to get super nationalistic about this. UPI is nice, and great for India but instant payments are not a new thing. Yes IMPS was quite an early adoption, but UPI (we call it alias based instant payments) has been largely implemented across the world.

I hope I get the visa as I have everything booked, from hotels and flights and my leaves are approved as well.

Tribalism will always be a challenge which is why I think a true federalist approach would make sense. Also, the North has a very different view of Western education than the South and you have to account for that.

I've heard about this on the local news while checking the weather as I was making dinner and I figured it it's even made its way to the local news, it's gotta be pretty bad because they almost never cover shit like that on basic ass cable news. At any rate, I don't eat beef or dairy since I can't tolerate it but I do eat chicken and eggs because those are some of the only protein sources I can tolerate (I have a complicated history of stomach issues that make it very difficult for me to eat a normal diet so I'm very limited in what I can eat compared to a normal person and every attempt to expand my diet beyond about 15 or so different types of food ends in failure no matter what I do, as my body just rejects most types of food for reasons I don't fully understand.)

I didn't say we should force people to undergo biopsies. I suggested that it would be nice to have such data. We don't. Absence of data doesn't magically turn into presence of data because it feels right. 

Intestinal infection is probably easier to test for by collecting poop samples. 

>And it is NOT sampling bias or selection bias to report what they reported. 

It is, they literally explain it in their paper limitations. My problem is with the news article, not the paper.

Quote:

>Finally, although it is tempting to attribute clinical findings observed in post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 to viral persistence, our study was not designed to address this question. 

What they have found is the basis for a hypothesis to test in the future. That's all.




>Viruses cannot travel throughout the body once the heart stops

The body is under pressure, right? Especially those patients on various life support machines. What happens when blood vessels crack (strokes and microstrokes, a well known feature of SARS-CoV-2) and various parts of the body are swamped with fluids? Even without a heart pumping, liquids leak. 

Now look at their paper:

>>Of 44 cases, 38 were determined to have died from COVID-19, and of these, 35 (92.1%) had either acute pneumonia or diffuse alveolar damage at the time of death (Supplementary Data 2)

Do you think they under CPAP? 

Do we know how all of them died, what is the order of failed systems? What is the order of shut down of life support? 

>>In the examination of 11 brains, we found few histopathologic changes, despite substantial viral burden.

What does that tell you? Did the virus wash into the brain or did it seed there and replicate? 

>>Vascular congestion was an unusual finding that had an unclear aetiology and could be related to the haemodynamic changes incurred with infection.

from Wikipedia:

*Vasocongestion, vascular congestion or vascular engorgement is the swelling of bodily tissues caused by increased vascular blood flow and a localized increase in blood pressure.*

HMMMM, I wonder if this changes anything regarding bodily fluids and their pressure in the body.

>>Tissues preserved for histopathologic analysis and special staining were dissected fresh at the time of autopsy

Presumably from frozen cadavers. Fresh body juices. Does it really have to be post-mortem replication? 

>>the median age was 62.5 years

Do you think that matters in this context? [Could endothelial health decline with age meaning people have crappier pipes as they get older?](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19619671/)

And, finally, to get to their weird claim:

>>We replicate these findings and conclusively demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of infecting and replicating within these and many other tissues, including brain. 

Doesn't mean that the infections aren't cleared in normal people. In fact, there's a whole aspect that they don't mention here: were the people immune compromised / deficient in any way? Because when you hear about the virus infecting various parts of the body, that's usually some poor human with no immune system to fight it off. And lots of people can be compromised without knowing it. Look at the cohort again: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05542-y#Sec2

Not enough detail. All I see is a bunch of old, sick, fragile people getting pummeled to death by SARS-CoV-2. Studying their cadavers to see how much territory SARS-CoV-2 ""won"" isn't as meaningful as you think. 

>This is science working as it is supposed to, not a failure of any kind.

The study is normal lab work, not really impressive. I've seen such studies before months ago, they cite them too. 

What I'd like to see is such methodology applied to people who didn't die of COVID-19, but of other diseases, later, weeks later, months later. Maybe people who died in car crashes, shootings, whatever. Just a random sample of places where the pandemic waves crossed. That would be more informative. 

This is the news release that bothers me: https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-12-autopsies-covid-virus-brain-body.html 

>Autopsies show COVID-19 virus in brain, elsewhere in body

>""Our focus on short postmortem intervals, a comprehensive standardized approach to tissue collection, dissecting the brain before fixation, preserving tissue in RNA later, and flash freezing of fresh tissue allowed us to detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels with high sensitivity by [polymerase chain reaction] and [in situ hybridization], as well as isolate virus in cell culture from multiple non-respiratory tissues including the brain, which are notable differences compared to other studies.""

Fresh meat

>Possible ramifications for long COVID

What we are saying is that the initial data is pointing the fact that COVID can exist in the brain for a much longer time than was previously suspected.

We have tried a year of “let it rip” and the results are horrible. Overall excess deaths are still at sky high levels, more people are dropping dead, even more are becoming disabled. 

Our society is stupid for not embracing better indoor ventilation and filtration. People are making poor decisions on not masking while in packed indoors settings because they believe COVID is mild now, and they don’t understand the long term damage it’s causing. 

In the absence of long term longitudinal studies we should be trying to limit the number of infections, not encouraging people to get sick over and over and over and over.",collapse

idfc bank & yes Bank ?,CreditCardsIndia
Honestly very good review 🙌,CreditCardsIndia
"1) DCB is actually quite nice. If HDFC would have offered equivalent RPs for the renewal fees it would have been ideal.

Actually then it would be a decent card to hold, now it adds that condition of making the 8L spends or Quarterly 4L to bypass the fees or level it up.

2) For international spends DCB is unreliable due to limited to no acceptability. For that I have AU Zenith+ which is a good option for a forex markup of only .99% and with travel rewards it more or less makes the spends rewarding too.

Other option that I was considering was Yes Marquee but it now has a spend criteria of 1L/qtr for lounge access ( this should be fine considering the DCB is accepted in almost all airports)",CreditCardsIndia

"Hey all, I'm currently in Vietnam and used the niyo dcb today. I withdrew 30,00,000 vnd and the atm asked to either convert (conversation charge 8%) or pay the access fee (2%), i chose the 2% option. The total charge was 30,60,000 and my account was debited with 10560 inr. The rate it gave me 284.9 and the google rate is 290.18. that access fee is messing things up. 

On top of that, niyo will charge 425(atm withdrawal fee) and 38+38 (both the gst)

Overall I paid 11061 for 30L vnd. The final conversation charge comes to 271, which is still better than local exchange which is 200-220 Vnd per rupee

Are there charges for this card? The niyo website isn't clear on this part.,IndiaCreditCardsHub

"Used niyo in dubai, it was really good, didn't like the daily limit on cash withdrawal though, I bought a laptop so had to withdraw 2 times because the shopkeeper wanted cash only, other than that it was accepted everywhere.
About loading money, I had already setup UPI on it, so I was able to easily transfer from my other accounts to it.",IndiaCreditCardsHub
"Used it in 5 countries, no issues till date apart from a transaction in Thailand where I was charged a DCC fee",IndiaCreditCardsHub
"your point no 1, 2 and 6 are same with any cards, they are not specific to niyo card.

1st one is for security so that scammers cant steal your money.

2nd is also for security so that not any random person can steal OTP from a malware app on your phone to steal your money

standard practice implemented by all banks

and i dont even know why you will be going outside without planning and sending your money to the required cards before hand. that too taking a new card and going out of country without even checking it for the first time is not a smart move. that is on us, not on Niyo.

however no 3 will not be a problem, because these days almost everyphone is dual sim you can have your india sim and local sim without an issue. and load money anywhere(i have loaded money in singapore malaysia nepal and thailand) using both wifi and local sim card, as long as your bank registered sim is in the same slot your bank apps(phonepe, gpay) will work(atleast they worked in the above mentioned countries).

after writing all of the above it sounds like iam arguing with you but infact iam giving explaiantions for the situations that you mentioned. so let me give you one last info, may be i will sound nice. :)

niyo DCB is far better than any CC, becuase with Niyo you can withdraw money from ATM if any specific location requires cash money. where as if you do that with CC it will be charged heavily. also when more than one person is with you. take add-on cards, that is what i did when i go outside, take multiple cards or take add-on card for the same card so all can use it. (my AU Ixigo rejected just because without any reason. while unicard is approved and delived within a week)

Happy Travels.",IndiaCreditCardsHub
"That’s not always the case. Some POS machines will give that option before the tap.

If it’s a direct tap, it’s in local currency",IndiaCreditCardsHub
"It doesn't always show the option, but if it does, always and always choose local currency",IndiaCreditCardsHub
">niyo DCB is far better than any CC, becuase with Niyo you can withdraw money from ATM if any specific location requires cash money. where as if you do that with CC it will be charged heavily. also when more than one person is with you.

Hi, so this is not true as Niyo has free withdrawals at only specific ATMs and not all. It is also not better than ANY CC as there are CCs with low to zero ATM withdrawal rates + benefit of rewards on spending (international spending more specifically with some cards)

>also when more than one person is with you. take add-on cards, that is what i did when i go outside, take multiple cards or take add-on card for the same card so all can use it.

Yup, did this, as mentioned in the post about the use of Atlas and Amex Platinum Travel.

As for the explanation before these points, thanks for the inputs, they may be useful to others here. It doesn't personally interest me as the post is aimed at practical tips for people who will use the Niyo card and not a theoretical background. The reasons behind the caveats are irrelevant IMO as long as you know how to work through them with this specific card.",IndiaCreditCardsHub

Sir we can't do away with cards completely. There have been times when I have wanted to do a UPI payment but there was no proper phone 4g signal in the restaurant and had to fallback on debit card. You have a point on the Visa and Mastercard fees but you can always request your bank to give you a RuPay debit card.,IndiaInvestments
Cards should exist. We depend too much on our phones these days. What if the phone dies while you are out? What will you do? And RuPay cards exist.,IndiaInvestments
"I agree. Bank should adopt more open standards and make people life a little less complicated.

I'm very happy that atleast we reached this UPI stage even before many developed countries. But going cardless completely isn't possible now as there are many situations where cards help you more. 

But future will be cardless for sure",IndiaInvestments
"You require an OTP with your card, CVV and often the numbers from the grid on the back. 

In case you drop your card/it gets stolen, you can disable it from the web/app. If you're concerned about worst cases, you can keep the 'Tap to Pay' disabled. If you're using it offline, you've got your PIN.
Even with a stolen card, not much can happen.


How is it a nuisance in any manner whatsoever?
As far as Visa/MasterCard goes, we have RuPay now.",IndiaInvestments
"There is a thing called inter bank - transaction charge where flow of funds from one bank to another take service charge.. visa, mc and all in return of seemless and less complicated fund transfers charge money from both banks.. and it all has to do with HARD CASH..
If u see the credit card system, they charge for cash withdrawal, but maynot charge for online transaction (upto certain extent) even debit cards restrict cash withdrawal upto certain number of times and if exceed will charge you..

Now UPI is a multi Bank online transaction system where no usage of CASH is required... But taking out CASH via UPI of another bank account will for certain attract somekind of fees (otherwise some ATMs will always run dry)

And also keeping UPI free is a big financial burden (server maintenances, transactions details log storage etc) and CASH distribution (which is already heavily rely on backend support i.e. from printing to refilling of ATMs, which again costs money) will only increase that burden 

Also it will discourage CASH flow in country and push citizens towards Digital platforms",IndiaInvestments
"Sir, the government is bearing the cost of infrastructure required for running UPI. Tech savvy people can use these facilities. 

I would strongly support the card system until we have a worthy replacement.",IndiaInvestments
"1. Yono cash came before upi atm, so it's not a replacement/copy of upi atm but it's own little feature.
2. UPI cash just came out. Give it a year, I'm sure it will be adopted by major banks.
3. NO, moving away from cards entirely is dumb. Imagine you stuck somewhere with a dead phone and no cash, cards and upi features will coexist in future but redundancies are important in payment sector",IndiaInvestments
"There are so few atms that actually work, that this question is stupid anyway. There is no incentive for banks to ensure that Atms work as intended because they don't make money from it. So that alone is the main bottleneck here. Also UPI is free and that's why everyone uses it which makes no incentive for banks to add more work for themselves with nothing to show for it.",IndiaInvestments

"Well, cards seem to have a 100% success rate than QR payments at my local departmental store. QR payments fail most of the time. And, not everyone is comfortable with mobile payments. My parents love card payments because all you got to do is show the card and enter the PIN. 

With mobile payments, you have to worry about signal, battery, app bugs, etc. But, I love UPI for online payments. It's simple and efficient. You don't need to put in the card details. Just type the UPI address and validate the payment request with PIN. I just don't like offline merchant payments. It's too slow.",IndiaInvestments
We have choice *99# in dail pad when not network which required bhim to install with same phone number,IndiaInvestments
"Rupay is an interesting project, yeah! In my experience though, most banks will try and sell you the VISA/MasterCard unless you tick the Rupay specifically on form as they get more revenue (maintenance) there.

If 4g signal doesn't work, you can use cash? Carrying a little bit of that doesn't hurt even in the digital age. Even if we can reduce card use considerably, I think it will be a great win.",IndiaInvestments
Consortium of Banks is bearing the cost...not Government. They have proposed to collect charges which will be less as compared to Visa / MasterCard,IndiaInvestments
"> the government is bearing the cost of infrastructure required for running UPI

Why would a bank have problem with bearing UPI infrastructure if they have no problem bearing card infrastructure? And not just cards, banks have a laundry list of expenditure towards printing of cheque books, passbooks, withdrawal/deposit forms, so many branch premises in small areas, security guards, etc. which will all be saved if people become tech savvy and switch to UPI!

I think banks should have no problem bearing costs of few UPI servers if they have already been spending so much on these other things for so many years. Let banks and govt. negotiate on this.",IndiaInvestments

"The number ""*99#"", which is a USSD code, can be dialed only from Airtel, Vi, and BSNL. It doesn't work with Jio, since the 4G LTE standard doesn't support USSD codes.

[Reference article](https://wap.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/govt-to-refund-mdr-losses-to-banks-on-digital-payments-for-fy23-121121501543_1.html),IndiaInvestments
"Few UPI servers? I think all of us are aware of how many transactions are being made using UPI and how 'few' UPI servers would be sufficient for those.


The banks aren't bearing this cost for UPI, the government is reimbursing them for the loss. And I don't think credit cards are bad products for the banks, a lot of them have annual fee through which there is a fixed income for the bank from user every year, and the charges that are deducted from debit card and credit cards is called as 'Merchant Discount Rate' and that is borne by the merchant and not by the banks, the banks are the ones who are profiting from every transaction and the number of transactions are the highest on credit card user base as some of them are trying to achieve the yearly spend limit which makes their annual charge to be waived off. 

And the transactions made on credit cards are by far the highest, even in a country like India where the number of credit cards are low. Banks also earn from late fee, EMI transactions processing fee and through a plethora of options. Banks mostly aren't on the losing Side. 


Whereas in the case of UPI, and RuPay network, they are. The moment government stops reimbursing the banks, the banks will stop issuing RuPay cards as they have 0 MDR.

And the times that I've lost money on UPI, it has been a long struggle to get my money back and I haven't received it back till date. Whereas on my credit card, I've had transaction failures and the banks reimbursed me with a click of a button.",IndiaInvestments
"Why do you want to depend on your phone for everything? Didn't you ever learn that redundancy is usually a good thing. That phone battery may die. Phone may break in an accident. There may be no mobile signal in some areas. It's ridiculous to think we should get rid of cards and cash and only use UPI.

I live in the mountains. If I had to depend on UPI exclusively, I would be in deep deep trouble as there is no mobile tower in so many places.",IndiaInvestments

Sometimes the money received message comes after a few minutes and the auto wallahs don't believe they have received it until they see it in their app. With Uber that is not a problem because they know they will get payment from Uber itself.,IndiaInvestments
"Happened to me also couple of times! The trick is to not use postpaid or any of Ola/Uber payment systems, register there as ""Cash"" only. But when you get off, just ask if you can pay through Google Pay and they usually show you a QR code to scan.

They usually refuse postpaid as it takes some time for Ola company to pay them through that. Sometimes, they don't have their number registered correctly in Ola system, so you end up paying ""digitally"" but the dude says they haven't received it! If you raise a complaint for twice payment, Ola usually refunds you immediately in such a situation.",IndiaInvestments

"> There is a serious need to upgrade port infra in India. Only 2 of India's ports feature in the top 50 global ports - Jawahar Nehru port (35 rank in 2019) and Mundra port (39 rank in 2019). This is despite India being a huge consumer market. The rankings haven't improved in the past 3-4 years

Piss poor , I don't even want to go into how bad we have been at ports management despite having such large coastline and almost center of trade routes via sea

---

Just a rant from some other thread, pasting here

Overall, Mundra port handled 144.4 million tonnes (mt) of cargo in FY21, clocking a growth of 4 per cent on a year-on-year basis.

This is nothing when you compare it to Colombo port which handles 4 million TEUs annually

Indian Coast does not have the required draft depth to handle capsize ships and so only Panamax ships can land at India.

Nearly 25 per cent of all containers originating from India are transshipped through foreign ports. Around 80 per cent of this is handled by Colombo, Singapore and Klang (Malaysia), all of which are foreign ports.

One, according to a report on the Ministry of Shipping’s Sagarmala portal, Indian ports lose out Rs 1,500 crore of potential revenues each year on transshipment handling of cargo either originating or destined for India.

“..industry estimates put the burden of transshipping through Colombo for Indian shippers at $200 to $250 per container unit on average,” a 2019 report

A part of the Colombo port, which has the largest share of the Indian transshipment pie at over 40 per cent, is already run by China. Beijing runs the International Container Terminals at the Colombo port, which accounted for 40 per cent of all container-traffic in the island country in 2019. China is also investing billions in areas around the port.

A proposal for deepening the channel has been sent to the government for consideration, a Port Trust official said. A deeper draft would allow bigger ships to dock and help tranship Indian containers in Kochi instead of Colombo, the preferred regional transhipment hub for exporters and importers.",IndiaSpeaks

"> Currently, rail only accounts for ~18% of total goods transported. road accounts for ~71%, despite being expensive, riskier and more pollutive, compared with railways.

The transport figures look similar in countries like China and the US. Road accounts for the highest share of total freight movement, which makes sense. However the share of road is still lower than India, in the range of 50-60%. The only issue with India is that the railways has been very very ineficient. People never know when their goods will reach destination. Although things have improved a lot in the past few years, there's more that needs to be done. We have a massive rail network which if leveraged well, can bring down out logistics cost drastically. Currently, India's per km logistics cost are on the higher side.",IndiaSpeaks

"Something to remember, the RoK is preparing for a fight in it's backyard, China, DPRK, (maybe) Japan, they're all close by, this means they can invest more in combat capabilities than the logistics that countries like the US have to. This means their $$$ get them more value in combat capabilities than a lot of other countries will.

They're also moving more high tech because like all developed countries conscription is becoming less publically acceptable and with higher costs, the opportunity cost of having your young people spend time being forced to be in the army is higher when you're a high income developed nation than a poorer one. So the optimal balance between *lots of guys* and *lots of gear for our guys* is swinging for them closer to *lots of gear*.

Their naval buildup is definitely a response to China/Japan though, north korea lacks the ability to do much in the naval theatre so the RoK navy would be on the offensive, be it launching missile strikes, launching aircraft, deploying ground troops, all of that is more expensive to do via the sea than the land.

I'm skeptical over whether RoK intends to launch amphibious assaults against the DPRK, it's extremely complex and requires so much more resources, it's also extremely risky, a unit that gets bogged down can be wiped out on the beach. *But element of surprise* the norks will probably see it coming, there's only so much coastline suited to amphibous assaults (which will be easily mined/obsticled) and the ships will be easily detected, plus the small size of the korean peninsula means retasking troops to oppose a landing is easy.

Amphibious assaults on contested islands against China (or defending against those) is more likely as there's no other option to contest the land.

I doubt invading deep into DPRK is a priority anyway, the RoK wants to contain the norks and keep them away from their population centers, invading deep into their territory gains very little. If the intent is to force the way in to destroy nuclear capabilities then the US will likely be on board and capable of handing the amphibious assaults. They officially care about unification but the thought of a vicious war to occupy territory and then take care of the starving population isn't appealing to most South Koreans. 

*But east/west germany* it's far harder for korea. The population ratio of west:east was higher than south:north, also the gdp per capita ratio of west:east was lower than south:north, they've been seperated for far longer and the DPRK regime makes East germany look positively sane. German reunification wasn't all rainbows and happiness either.",neoliberal
"The new Aircraft Carrier seems the most telling.  Traditionally, aircraft carriers are used as power projection tools.   This doesn't make much sense as South Korea's main security risk is North Korea.  An F16 with has an effective combat radius of 550 km (which is fairly standard for multi-role fighters).  Even if launched from the tip of the peninsula in Busan or Gwangju, F16s can still reach most of North Korea including Pyongyang.  An aircraft carrier costing over 40 Bln usd is not something to be thrown at the wall for extra measure.   

The carrier could symbolize a growing desire for South Korea to be a larger player in Eastern Asia.  A carrier doesn't make much sense if you're attacking Pyongyang, or even trying to do Inchon 2.0 (RoK already has two \*amphibious\* assault ships better suited to \*amphibious\* landings than the new carrier).  Where a new aircraft carrier would be useful is if it were to be parked in the South China Sea, or in the Taiwan Straight.  

A new Carrier is a big investment and most likely shows that the RoK is thinking farther than the North Korean threat, and starting to worry about China and/or even Japan from a national security stand point.",neoliberal

"I doubt that unification is actually on the table in such an eventuality, but removing the Kim regime and setting up a new government that is... less crazy and maniacal and sabre-rattling is practically assumed.



Just the threat of a large amphibious assault pins down North Korean resources. Also, North Korea's C3I is vulnerable and South Korea is pretty good at mine warfare, so I'd be inclined to say that a South Korean amphibious assault is definitely possible and is indeed an option they've planned for.",neoliberal
"A carrier does have one value vs North Korea, they are significantly easier to hide than any land based airstrip, especially if your opponent lacks satellites. Any terrestrial airbase in the south is vulnerable to North Korean ballistic missiles, a carrier can stand off at safe distance when tensions increase and launch strikes without being vulnerable to the same type of attack.

Certainly you don't build one *just* for that, but it's worth considering.",neoliberal
"They’re building carriers because shelling from the North Koreans in the case of a war could easily destroy a good amount of their airfields.

"I think one will show up eventually if I don't get tired of this, but I think it'll probably be after several others covering various East Asian military/geopolitical problems. The USN has... issues; so does the USAF to an extent and they're often the same ones.",neoliberal

"\>  I doubt that unification is actually on the table in such an  eventuality, but removing the Kim regime and setting up a new government  that is... less crazy and maniacal and sabre-rattling is practically  assumed. 

So be an occupying power trying to build a new regime, denying Nork citizens the right to immigrate to the south or access those government services? Sounds like sewing the seeds of insurgency. I don't think south korea wants in any way to have to be responsible for the millions of Nork citizens. 

\>  Just the threat of a large amphibious assault pins down North Korean  resources. Also, North Korea's C3I is vulnerable and South Korea is  pretty good at mine warfare, so I'd be inclined to say that a South  Korean amphibious assault is definitely possible and is indeed an option  they've planned for. 

Unless they literally cut the Norks in two accross the peninsula I don't see why an amphibious assault is going to screw up their C3I in a way a shittone of air strikes (seriosuly, amphibious warefare is expensie) on comms nodes doesn't. Once you're commited to a beach you've generally got to stick with it, so all they need to do is say which of the very limited sites the RoK have hit and there will be troops on the way.

Mine warefare? Sure but what does that have to do with amphibious assaults? Amphibious assaults require movings lots of men and equipment over the sea and over a hostile shore, then supporting them there, mine warfare is the opposite in many ways, you can roll in fast, drop em and bail.

Pinning down forces? Could they not do that over the DMZ where they can do the same thing but without a bunch of expensive ships? The Norks still have a distinct advantage in raw numbers, the RoK wants a narrow front they can hold onto so their (and the US) superior firepower can whittle down those infantry/tanks.

In summary I don't think the RoK really wants to conquer the north, in which case an amphibious assault is largely a waste since they plan to withdraw anyway, even if they wanted to conquor them they'd get far more value for out of their troops/$$$ by investing in their army to push through the DMZ instead of a bunch of expensive ships to hit one of a small number of suitable landing zones.",neoliberal
"Both nuclear subs and carriers are tools for reach, nuclear subs have incredible range/endurance far from home and carriers are an expensive way to get an airbase where you otherwise won't have them. The only potential enemies are close by to them so they can invest more in the ""tooth"" of ""tooth and tail"". 

I think they'll be sticking to small carriers (for F35Bs) for the forseeable future, they don't need a full scale CATOBAR, possibly they'll stick to duel use carriers like the America class that function both as Amphibs and carriers depending on their aircraft loadout.",neoliberal

Kiwi Yes Bank is Fintech co-branded so eventually it'll end up like One Card but it's good for now.

"Tata Neu Infinity. I have the LTF one really saves money on my groceries. 

I don't have Kiwi card, but from what I can see, the 5% cashback is only applied after spending of 1.5 lakh uptil 1.5L it is 2% right? Correct me if I'm wrong. If this is correct then it means Tata Neu Infinity saves 7,500 rs on 1.5L spend while Kiwi saves 3,000. 

This means that even if someone takes the paid Tata Neu Infinity, the paid Tata Neu Infinity Card is better than LTF Kiwi, unless of course your annual UPI spends is extremely low.

Edit: Tata Infinity UPI cashback is 1.5% not 5%, stupid mistake by me. Kiwi becomes better for UPI specific transactions.",CreditCardsIndia

It is worth noting here that Rupay cards only work with merchant payments on UPI. Moreover, most offline merchants do not accept payments above 2000 via rupay credit cards.

Is the Neon subscription still First Year Free ? What is the fees after that ?,CreditCardsIndia
"Only tata neu rupay card. 
Visa and MasterCard does not work anyways in UPI.",CreditCardsIndia
I think it's 1.5L per year,CreditCardsIndia
"Per month limit will be 1% of your credit card limit, 

if limit is 3,00,000 then per month limit is 3000",CreditCardsIndia
1% of your credit limit. It's there on the Kiwi website > About Us > Rewards.,CreditCardsIndia
Is this legitimate?,CreditCardsIndia
yes i applied as the first card :),CreditCardsIndia
"Ah, completely forgot about the uppercap, my bad.
 
You're right, 1.5% for UPI, 5% is purchases on Tata brand, dunno how I got so muddled. In that case, Kiwi is clearly better.",CreditCardsIndia
You can opt-in once you get the virtual card. But seems Neon is FYF for all who apply till Oct 31.,CreditCardsIndia
"No, the 5% is for all spends up to that point and beyond.",CreditCardsIndia
"Through their app on Android. Seems while the app can be used on Android and iOS, applications only work on the Android app. You need to use your mobile number linked to UPI and which hopefully is with CIBIL too. If you did do that and still faced an issue, could be a technical error. You can also take it up with YES Bank customer service: 18001031212 or Kiwi service@gokiwi.in | Whatsapp : +91 8147089992",CreditCardsIndia
how do i know it is a merchant QR?,CreditCardsIndia
Better to have separate category dye to limitations on rent payment,CreditCardsIndia

3 categories are missing here which are exclusive of utilities and most cards do not cater those categories.

Rent
Government Transactions 
Insurance",CreditCardsIndia
"Super.money is an UPI app by Flipkart, which gives cashback for every UPI transaction upto 5%. It can vary from 0.1 to 5, additionally if you use your rupay cc, you'll get the points as well as the cashback from super.money.",CreditCardsIndia
Yeah just like regular UPI give cashback even for credit card it does give. I have gotten it multiple times.,CreditCardsIndia
"you get ""kiwis"" basically coins which convert 4kiwis to 1rs and they directly get credited into your bank account",CreditCardsIndia
"I think more than the name of a start-up, it's smarter to decide based on service quality, UI/UX of the app, whether promised rewards (Kiwis) are credited immediately as promised and the bank supporting it and whether the card is allowed to use the bank's offers (say 15% off on Swiggy Instamart on Yes Bank credit cards) or instant discount on Amazon during the recent sale.

On all counts Kiwi scores.

By the way, once upon a time there was a start-up with another funny name--Apple.",CreditCardsIndia
What problems do you think can happen? By the way the card is provided by Yes Bank.,CreditCardsIndia
"I haven't travelled with this but it works on all websites ,local shops.",CreditCardsIndia
Zilch,CreditCardsIndia
Yeah ui is shit. But 1.5% reward is better than other rupay cards,CreditCardsIndia
It must be a merchant qr i used this card on my shop's qr. Do a transaction of 2000 it gives 160 kiwi worth of 40 it also has milestones category also provides lounge access,CreditCardsIndia

"I wish I Saw this sooner. Thought it would be a decent card and applied for it yesterday.

i said for travel card bro not rupay,CreditCardsIndia
😂😂😂,CreditCardsIndia
What? Why would you say that,CreditCardsIndia
"Hey man, you're everywhere 🤣.thanksfor the reply. 
I understand the benefits of the card but I still understand the difference between Kiwi, Yes Bank, Axis bank Kwik. Are these 3 the same or are they different?? 
Also one more question, can I link non partner rupay card(say from HDFC) on the Kiwi app for rewards?",CreditCardsIndia
I have another card from yes bank. Am i not eligible for this?,CreditCardsIndia
I am looking for my first Credit Card will I be eligible for this no credit history also if not what would you advice which Rupay Credit Card I should Go for My major expense is Rent so that's why Rupay Credit card I want,CreditCardsIndia
you have to take a subscription for 2% which is fyf currently,CreditCardsIndia
Merchant QRs only,CreditCardsIndia
"You get 2% in kiwi app only (only scan and pay). Similar to tata neu.

Unlike tata neu, you can redeem instantly after you get the coins.",CreditCardsIndia
"Ha Ha! I like the card, hence wrote.",CreditCardsIndia
Yeah that's a major issue,CreditCardsIndia
"Agree, Their website is still based on Axis Bank Kiwi variant. Not very confidence-inspiring. Jupiter CSB was amazing when they started too (another fintech, like Kiwi, who tied up with multiple banks for different products). May be this will go down the same lane.

"Kiwi Yes Bank credit card can only be used to pay merchants who have UPI payments via credit card enabled. Which credit card will allow payments to friends?

Though the Kiwi app now does seem to give some tiny cashback for regular UPI transactions too. Is negligible. Perhaps a limited time thing.",CreditCardsIndia
"Yes, still first year free till Feb-end now, I believe. 999 per year after that is what they are saying. But most folks will cancel the card rather than pay 999 for Neon.",CreditCardsIndia

I just registered for kiwi now.is there a way to get the kiwi neon version ?,CreditCardsIndia
"Kiwi offers greater IG, for a LTF",CreditCardsIndia
What good are those junk neu coins for? In kiwi you can redeem directly into your bank account anytime.,CreditCardsIndia
Thank you so much!,CreditCardsIndia
"If this card, doesn't work then I don't think any other Rupay will work. 

But the reward redemption is atrocious. Go for yes Bank kiwi.",CreditCardsIndia
"2% on some selected categories, can only change the category after 3 months.

 2% in the form of jewels, can be only redeemed as vouchers (sometimes vouchers of specific brands run out of stock)

Points only if you use the Jupiter app or swipe card.

Need to open a savings bank account to even apply for the card.

Yes kiwi give 2% UPI cashback flat unlike this card. Kiwi points can also be converted directly to cash.

Is that enough for you u/BigDaddySunshine_5?",CreditCardsIndia
Okie…thanks for the info,CreditCardsIndia
Axis Ace has rupay version??,CreditCardsIndia
"This topic is for a Rupay card ""bro"", not a travel card!",CreditCardsIndia
"Kiwi is a fintech. They can't issue their own credit card AFAIK, So they partner with banks. Jupiter partnered with Federal Bank for savings account, then credit card and finally launched another credit card with Catholic Syrian Bank. Similarly Kiwi first partnered with Axis and now Yes. 

Yes you can link non partner Rupay cards on Kiwi. Have linked my Jupiter Edge CSB Rupay card and my Kotak IOCL Rupay.",CreditCardsIndia
"According to the Spendwisely channel on Telegram, existing YES Bank credit card customers are not eligible. You could apply and try.",CreditCardsIndia
"It's a starter credit card. Evaluation by YES Bank. Rent is an excluded category on this card, so you won't get cashback or milestone benefits.",CreditCardsIndia

where does it say LTF? you link just asks for mobile number and it has photo the the cards,CreditCardsIndia
"Some people say 2-4 days for approval. For me it took around 8-9 days. I even got an email saying there was a delay. The initial part is a pain for those who get early approval because the virtual card details seem to take time. While for me, on approval, all details were available and I could use it immediately.",CreditCardsIndia
Sorry to hear that. Wish you better luck in 3 months,CreditCardsIndia
yes but suppose I go to a shop and there is a qr in front of me how do i know it is merchant qr? are there some signs?,CreditCardsIndia
"Gst, Income tax, nps.",CreditCardsIndia
"yes, you get in multiples of 50  
4 kiwis, every 50rs  
so if you do 150rs,  
you get 12kiwis or 3rs  
but if you even do 149, you get 8kiwis  
hope that clears it up",CreditCardsIndia
IG?,CreditCardsIndia
What is the rate of redemption of the kiwi rewards?,CreditCardsIndia
Well expiry date of neu coins keep extending as neu conis from bill generation are added in your account. So you can either use them for your daily grocery shopping in big basket or stack them for a gadget purchase from croma.,CreditCardsIndia
"I was a bit hesitant about it since its new in the market  
But I've seen a lot of support for it so far on the forums",CreditCardsIndia
"I agree with the category thing.

Never faced the problem of not getting the vouchers I wanted.

I use the Jupiter app because I find it very convenient.

NO NEED TO OPEN a Jupiter account. I have the card without the Jupiter account.

"Thank you, I hold a yes bank card, reward redemption is a bit complicated. 1reward point is ₹0.10 cash & intermiles, ₹0.15-0.25 for vouchers(Amazon/Flipkart are valued low), ₹0.25 for flight booking. So am a bit skeptical about yes bank. All reviews point to flight redemption which isn’t useful for me, got to know the above redemption options after getting the card and logging in to rewards portal.",CreditCardsIndia
On their website it says 2 kiwis every 50. Where did you see 4?,CreditCardsIndia
I meant 'I guess',CreditCardsIndia
1 kiwi point is 0.25. Min redemption is 4 kiwis so re 1,CreditCardsIndia

"Rice is the latest staple food on the brink of a global crisis following India's partial ban on exports. The government in New Delhi hopes the move will lower prices and improve availability domestically.

The Indian government has banned the export of non-basmati white rice - trigging fears of shortages and price rises across the world.

India is the world's largest supplier of the food - making up 40% of global exports - which more than three billion people rely on as a staple.

Last year it exported around 22 million tonnes, of which almost half constituted the now-banned non-premium rice.

The ban comes after the cost of rice soared by 11.5% in a year in the country, and the government has introduced the ban in the hope it will lower prices and improve availability domestically.

But their grievance goes deeper they love Russia and hate USA because the US imposed sanctions on Venezuela which crippled the country and caused it to collapse. It's  hard for me to argue with them because they are genuinely nice people  deluded  by Russian propaganda and hate for the US.

I honestly feel it's time for the US to make friends with Venezuela they could literally fuck Russia in the ass if they could pull it off. It's absolutely mind boggling how the US intentionally creates endless Russian sympathizers in their back yard by doing complete bullshit.

Like I know a guy from Panama his parents from Cuba and he supports Russia 100% he said it with his  own mouth he doesn't care what Putin does he could use Nukes he will always support Russia over the US because of how they treated Cuba.

Rice will likely see a 3-7% decrease in production for the same temperature increase. Regionally, India is anticipated to have the highest impact at an 8-11% decrease per degree.

Consider the alternative, exports being sold from suppliers directly to distributors. If the supplier has a shortage of product, they will want to increase their prices to cover their losses. Due to the increase in price and decrease in supply from suppliers, distributors will also raise prices to cover their losses. Finally, you get to the end point of say a grocery store. With two price increases the large corporations will have the capital to swallow the increased prices where the small shops will not.

If we assume that governments will buy in bulk, the amount that they'll be able to purchase will be larger than any individual corporation, and should get a better price per unit because of that.

"No. Republicans helped Trump attempt to cheat in the 2020 elections in several ways, in addition to Russian, european and american far-right propaganda and misinformation being at an all time high during the election.

(Misinformation like Crowder, Turning Point, Tim Pool/Timcast et cetera is extremely popular.)

Postmaster DeJoy was tasked with delaying votes by mail and an attempt to have millions of votes excluded from the count on basis of coming in too late, but it failed in several ways; firstly, mail was not delayed enough, secondly, republicans were told that the hundreds of thousands of votes they still managed to delay significantly would be counted for as long as they were posted before the deadline.

Purging of voter rolls was done in several states, targeting demographics assumed to vote for democrats.

Stricter voter laws was inforced in several states, requiring picture ID, in states where this is not free and/or not accessible for the poor.

Voting locations were removed and personell required to arrange were not recruited to open voting locations, causing hourlong lines of voters, primarily in and around democratic districts.

Far right actors and bad faith actors were asked to meet up at voting locations with weapons to intimidate voters, and frankly, knowing the far right and fascists like Trump -- with the hopes of shootings happening around the country to make people afraid of voting.

\---

After the election, there were attempts from Trump's campaigns of having votes destroyed, and/or recounted with the goal of removing votes for democrats.See Trump's phonecalls to Georgia and other states, as well as the Cyber Ninjas and other known and probably unknown attempts of changing the results of state elections.

Also see the plots for sending fake electors for the electoral college.

\---

Finally, there's the multiple january 6th plots:

The police and FBI were told about the threat of terrorism and coup attempts, but for reasons still unknown, failed to be prepared for the planned coups they knew or should have known about.The FBI and DHS, both led by republicans hired by Donald Trump, failed, and one cannot assume they did anything wrong by their employer:Chad Wolf became responsible for analyzing threats and risks for the DHS and had the role before January 6th at DHS.Wray at the FBI also failed to act in a meaningful way.Have Mike Pence refuse to confirm Biden and confirm Trump instead.They failed to 'convince' him, so a partial plot on January 6th was to have Mike Pence removed by Secret Service so that he could not confirm Biden.

The final plot was violence. FBI unwittingly may have prevented terrorists from bringing guns, by arresting the Proud Boys leader on january 5th, forcing them and the other terrorist groups to evaluate wheter or not to bring weapons or let their own safety take priority on the day of the coup.Oath Keepers had a cache of weapons at their hotel, and chose not to bring them. Their leader has said, after january 6th, that his greatest regret that day was not bringing the guns.[https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/oath-keeper-testifies-massive-gun-pile-stashed-hotel-eve-jan-6-rcna51749](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/oath-keeper-testifies-massive-gun-pile-stashed-hotel-eve-jan-6-rcna51749)

...

America was part lucky that democracy survived, and part lucky that Trump and his co-traitors were and still are incompetent idiots.

Putin trusted the republicans to succeed in winning the election or the coup.  
Furthermore, there was not supposed to be a war.  
Putin intended to start a war campaign, and have FSB assassins and special forces within Ukraine murder Zelenskyy and key persons in the government, and force an election in which a sick russian puppet won.  
It was supposed to become a vassal state under Russia fast and without so many losses, and the war is just an uintended failure that keeps going because other plots to force surrender and threaten Ukraine's allies fail.

"Didn't Unkraine catch some assassins after Zelenskyy right as this was kicking off? I'm pretty sure it was in one of those talking heads news pieces.

Also, there was more to the Jan 6th plot that is just now coming out as well which made it even more evident everything throughout this rested on some pretty small timing windows. Somehow most of them ended up being a just barely missed situation. The thing is there are plenty of times in history where the first attempt like this failed but the second was a success. I, like most of us, can't do much. I always vote so I'll do that but beyond that what can we do? They're doing so much to make sure votes against them don't count.

If I am being truthful to myself I'd just admit I want out. If I had money me and my family would be living somewhere else right now because I think this country is being pushed down a very dark path by all this pretend Christian BS. If the Republicans have their way we will be as third world as any country has ever been with women little more than captive baby manufacturers in their own homes and it terrifies me for my grandchildren.

Trump showed us who the role models were. Duterte who praises Hitler, Saddam Hussein, Kim Jong Un, Xi Jinping, Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, and Recep Tayyip Erdogan. That m4eans get ready for no religious freedom, ex-judicial killings of whomever they deem deserving, no free press, if you are lucky jail for criticizing the government but more likely torture and death, protests banned and any who try killed - Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi had 800 protestors killed in a single day - enslavement, sexual violence, forced abortions, forced to carry children no matter the damage to the mother, prison camps, pretty much every human rights violation out there.

">Politics plays a role, but not a great role in managing inflation.


It's actually the biggest role in the Indian context.


India has adopted policies that are anti free  market. Subsidies, government spending, etc. 


The Food Corporation of India bares a large responsibility for the increase in food prices as well.


https://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/from-plate-to-plough-stop-nourishing-food-inflation/2446191/lite/



People won't accept that their social welfare schemes have consequences. They can't accept making government throw money at problems in agriculture hasn't solved any problems. That would require questioning their political philosophy. That would require millions of Indians being fired from government offices. Relatives, friends, families, etc. That would mean radical changes in religion beliefs and identity.

Second, way to assume no one knows hunger.  There are plenty of hungry kids in the rural areas.  I used to be one.  When I was 14 I tied my flannel around my waist over the summer because my stomach hurt from a lack of food.  An immigrant family from Africa asked me why I did that and I honestly told them because it hurts since I hadn't eaten in three days.  They were the ones that informed me to slowly loosen my flannel so that I don't die when I finally do get food and to eat only half of what I normally would eat the first day so I don't die.  Then they gave me a small bit of rice.  I was so thankful for their sharing and their advice.

There are certain restrictions to private entities to enter into banking sector sure but this also protects the people from not having to go through the financial fraud levels that happen in US where big banks just blow away their customers money in shady practices

I feel India has had the right amount of balance of public and private entities in the banking sector. Private companies provide much better services but they can also be risky in the sense that there is no guarantee the government will bail it out in case of any crisis. Public companies in babking turn have to get better competing with private companies either by catching up to the services provided by the private companies or providing  safety in time of crisis where government is likely to bail it out.",india

"That idiot's stupid enough to conflate any and all forms of research with tech bro pipe dream. And I mean, he literally dismissed our research in hyperloop technology purely because we aren't ""democratic"". I don't think we're doing it for the optics anymore. Not at this point. If we were doing it for optics we'd halt research on hyperloop.

The idea of hyperloop ie maintaining near vacuum pressure over hundreds or thousands of kilometers for accelerating a train does seem unfeasible, but hyperloop adjacent technologies are still being actively worked on. China's CASIC is working on a low pressure maglev that can reach speeds upto 1000km/hr, and they're also planning on building a 60km test track. It's a lot easier to maintain low pressure over a large area than nearly zero pressure.

And it's not like we're halting development on normal high speed rail to chase a pipe dream either. Development of a 280km/hr high speed train for MAHSR, and other future grade separated HSR lines, manufactured by BEML is underway. Then there's the 230km/hr broad gauge test track in Rajasthan which might soon become the standard for all rail lines in India in the future, for which there would be broad gauge high speed trains developed.

So, what's wrong with diversifying research? We may have worked on hyperloop for the past decade cause of optics, but now, we have the opportunity to get ahead of our peers and solve engineering problems.",unitedstatesofindia
"Not low air pressure but complete vacuum to make it even remotely profitable. And even then it will have to be remotely operated and will need completely new track systems that would have to be more sophisticated than bullet train tracks. Our rail ministery struggled to lay 2000km of normal old school track in the last year. This money could be used for things that are more practical like kavach system installation, better signalling systems, and high speed tracks. But hey atleast R and D right.",unitedstatesofindia

Because it is a pointless piece of technology. Linear induction motor trains make no sense unless it is for Maglev. So what is the point of creating a low pressure test track with just a linear induction motor ?  You could do the same thing with a normal train running in low pressure tubes. If that is the case then why even call it hyperloop ? And if you wanted to research linear induction motors then just start by testing maglev instead of this. This is just BharOS and made in india 5G level hype creation. Just vaporware meant to fool people.,unitedstatesofindia

If you have a metal tube that needs low pressure inside then for very little explosive the whole system can fall apart because it would take time to patch the hole properly and then to create low pressure.

And because it will need to cover long distances it can't effectively be guarded while being very easy to damage.",unitedstatesofindia

"Answer: you are probably being automatically set to ""hot"", if you sort by ""top"" the geographical focus disappears.


Happened to me too.",OutOfTheLoop
Answer: its the same for me. The global setting just doesnt work. Setting it to anonymous browsing will fix and setting location to canada seems to give me all the normal feed though including us election stuff. So you can try that if you dont want to go anonymous.,OutOfTheLoop
"Answer: Okay so this literally happened within the past day or so.

It doesn't affect everyone, which is why you get these hotshots in here acting like know-it-alls with their own realities.

There is some kind of bug with the geo_filter in /r/all/ and it seems to only affect the Hot tab. If you switch to new or top or rising it seems to go away.

For those that are being affected, it seems to skip past the default GLOBAL setting (""Everywhere"" on the pulldown menu) and go to your local region determined by your IP. This is happening to me on this account, but it's not happening to another account I use, though I only connect with that account through a VPN.

I seems to affect people from all manner of countries around the world. I'm not sure if it affects those in the US. I'm not sure if they would even notice any difference because of their IP location. Feel free to chime in if this applies to you.

There are people talking about this all over reddit, but none of the mods that reply seems to understand what anyone really means by their description. I haven't seen any admins respond to it. No one has responded at all on /r/help/.

That's what I know so far.",OutOfTheLoop
"Question: along these lines, what’s up with “best” comments in threads the last few weeks throwing random new comments in at like 30%? is it to give new ones a better chance in older threads?",OutOfTheLoop
"Question: ELI5, how does the front page work? I only come to reddit from RSS feeds on my subscribed subs, so while I hear people talk about ""the front page"" quite often, I have no idea what the heck it's all about or how it's populated.

A quick look at the main page now just shows a random-looking mix of non-organized topics from subreddits that I subscribe to, whereas my RSS feed collects everything by sub, with no algorithms tying to predict what interests me.",OutOfTheLoop

Friendly reminder that all **top level** comments must:  

1.  be unbiased, 

2.  attempt to answer the question, and 

3.  start with ""answer:"" (or ""question:"" if you have an on-topic follow up question to ask)

"This is an old blog post from when reddit changed how they sorted comments, but it may help explain it a bit: https://redditblog.com/2009/10/15/reddits-new-comment-sorting-system/",OutOfTheLoop
"Posting my answer from [another thread the the mods removed](https://old.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/jgp4r9/what_is_going_on_with_reddits_best_comment/) because it wasn't a ""loop"" it was a Reddit change and thus should be asked in /r/help, despite this thread being the exact same style of post. Mods of OOTL are the worst at consistent enforcement, or even understanding how their AutoMod rules work.

Anyway:

Answer: It is an A/B test Reddit is running. After the backlash moderators faced due to the hastily added Reddit Chat feature Admins promised moderators they would never do something that impacts user experience without letting the mods know, but then they implemented this change anyway. Admins rolled it out around two weeks ago, there's a thread about it [here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/j6w63o/did_something_happen_to_default_comment_sorting/)

Really not cool from the admins, it's pretty bullshit to edit user preferences without letting them know and without letting them opt-out or return to normal. Not to mention all the headaches it caused from mods who care about their custom CSS or flair filtering - many thought they had somehow disrupted the site, not the other way around.

edit: Adding a permalink to the Admin comment explaining this change. It can be found [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/j6w63o/did_something_happen_to_default_comment_sorting/g81cetx/). There is some good discussion and context as to why the change is so frustrating but the admin never replies to any of it, so you aren't missing much if you don't click the link. For visibility purposes I will copy the admin comment text:

>Good catch, I'm one of the admins behind this. This is a temporary experiment that we have just launched to help improve exposure of comments. We have seen data that shows that the earliest comments are the most successful. Given that, we want to see if showing newer comments can help better elevate the best content instead of the earliest. To do this, some users will see comments sorted by new for the first 25 or 50 comments. Once posts hit that threshold, they'll revert back to the users default preference. For some additional context behind our thought process, [please check out this relevant post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/j5vvds/oc_with_great_punctuality_comes_great/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) in r/dataisbeautiful.",OutOfTheLoop

"Oh, God, I just tried browsing r/all, and maybe I _do_ need an algorithm to sort things out.

I mean… like… seriously? People visit r/all? How is that remotely useful? I'm I so out of touch that I don't realize that the average redditor is high all of the time?

"Don't give clicks to the Guardian one. I know that makes people curious, so here's the rundown: it tries to come across as neutral (3/5 stars), but the review paints BTS and K-pop in general in a negative light. It leads with the story of a girl who apparently moved to SK for BTS, and it uses phrasing like ""battery farming of young performers tied to slave contracts,"" ""venal,"" and ""lurid"" to describe the K-pop industry. While the industry has plenty of problems, I'm not OK with the media sensationalizing it and using it to put BTS down.

It barely talks about the music at all, and the writer's opinion can be best summed up by the last sentence:
>Its actual contents are almost beside the point.

I'd rather a scathing review that was sincere over this garbage.

"I was just going to comment on it here, but you beat me to it. I agree with you, it's a garbage review.

Will just paste this snippet:

> you can’t imagine British teenagers are that desperate to hear youthful criticism of societal conventions in South Korea...  if boyband fandom is all about projecting your fantasies on to the performers, then perhaps a group whose lyrics you don’t understand represent an appealingly blank screen.

Let's be honest, he meant teenage girls. When a middle age man listens to world music on BBC4, society says he's cultured and educated. When a teenage girl listens to international music and tries to understand and empathize, he says she's vapid.",bangtan
"I never stray away from articles that criticize BTS because it's always nice to see what the other side see and think but I agree whole\-heartedly, that guardian article is garbage. It's not garbage because it's criticize BTS, but it's garbage because of its pre\-judgment bias, condescending and xenophobic tone that criticize but provide no solid argument. A writer who lacks self\-awareness, and open\-minded\-ness toward something outside of his or her comfort zone offer no voice or criticism worthwhile to be heard.

1. BTS's music is no different than British Chart Topping music is used a subtle diss. If other British chart topping music is worthy of praise, why is BTS's music who is no different should be criticized. Unless author can logically argued that current British music originated from Britain and uniquely to Britain, it's quite ""racist"" condescending tone to assume that BTS is music less worthy to be heard because it is LIKE British music but just in another language. This logic made no sense when lay bare but somehow is convoluted and used the by the author.
2. Teenagers claim that BTS's lyrics are socially conscious are actually just projecting their fantasy toward BTS because they are singing in another language. Lmao, and where is his evidence to back up this assertion except for the author's pre\-conceived bias? And why is that a valid argument or criticism against the group? That is an assumption made by the author that speak nothing but the author's limited worldview, and nothing about the group or its fanbase.
3. Kpop's slave contract nature. True, to a Western perspective Kpop contracts are very restrictive. But the author himself admitted that restrictive contract and manufactured pop is not limited to Kpop, and is pretty much alive in the name of Simon Cowell. But the table can be flipped from the other side. One can also made a generality that such a group under Simon Cowell is not worthy to listen to. And if such group is the only exposure one have toward British pop, they can also made the same assumption this author alluded to: British pop is not worthy to listen to. Using generalities is lazy journalism.

Not everyone will like everything they see. I would be fine if the author just simply don't like BTS's music but the whole article is reeks of laziness and close\-minded\-ness. The author show no willingness or enthusiasm when writing his/her article, whether to praise or criticize. If s/he show no willingness to write, s/he is not worthy being read.",bangtan
"Wow I clicked as I’m a Guardian reader, and wow the xenophobia was overflowing",bangtan
"That's why I don't like it when ARMYs push their ""goals"". It's too much pressure for the boys, as well as us. They deserve to break records authentically, and not because people were streaming on mute all night or something.

Let's just enjoy their music. Let them enjoy making their music. Good things will come our way in their own time, naturally.

Edit\- In retrospect, I don't like my tone in this comment. What I mean is, it's okay if you're working hard to support BTS, to show your love. But always remember, stanning BTS is NOT a chore. As long as you're enjoying it, it's fine. Let everyone participate as much as they want to. ",bangtan
"Even though I can’t even begin to imagine the amount of pressure the boys would feel but urgh this comment really brought me back to earth. Right now all these news outlets and companies are paying attention to them because they are on top of the world. Should the day come when they stop breaking records, I worry if those blatantly xenophobic reviews and all those ppl who judge bts’s voices will get louder and louder. I don’t want the boys to go through that hurt and it hurts me more that we might’ve set that up for them by pushing them up too hard. I hope we can support them until American gp begins to accept them but also wonder if that’s too high of a goal especially during these recent years where you realize America might be way more xenophobic than it initially seems (cough trump... )",bangtan
yeah i definitely feel that way too. I often wonder if BTS would be happier if they weren't as popular as they are. It would mean so much less pressure on them.,bangtan
"People love to shit on things girls like. I'll say what I said in another comment I made a while back.

>Think about the Beatles and how big they were and how huge their fangirl base was. Now when we look back on them all these years later, we don't see them as just a ""girl thing"". Same with the composer Franz Liszt. Lisztomania was a real thing. No one this day and age will discredit the Hungarian Rhapsodies or Liebestraum as just frivolous fangirl things. 

In the end, good music is good music and people should be a lot more open minded.

"With respect to salaries, I think you should also mention how your passport decides your base pay. South East Asians, Africans, and migrants from other poorer countries will be paid peanuts compared to someone from Europe or North America. Even if you have more qualifications than them, there is a high chance that Westerners will be paid more than you.

Another thing to mention is that I found the city to be too fake. It is like a giant amusement park filled with plastic people. The society there is too materialistic and vapid. Again, this might be a personal opinion and while I know a lot of people who would agree with my take, there are plenty who are okay with what Dubai has to offer.

No worries about visa, write off any expectation of citizenship and make money from India entity. A comfortable tax free first world life. Near perfect.",india
"I lived in Dubai for most of my life. Grew up there. It's a very nice place to live, provided you have a good enough paying job. I've lived in India, Dubai, UK and Germany and I can say that the luxury you have in Dubai is not matched by India or Germany. Germany obviously has many other advantages but a luxurious life isn't one of them. You have to do everything yourself, the Indian community isn't big if you're not in a big city, the food isn't great and the language is a barrier to entry. In Dubai you don't even need to know a word of Arabic, the food is amazing (you'll find great and cheap food not only from India but Turkey, Lebanon, etc), getting a house help is relatively cheap, there are Indians everywhere so you'll never be lonely, etc. plus the other advantages OP mentioned. 

The disadvantages OP mentioned are correct as well. No citizenship, dependence on employer, different rules for expats and different rules for locals, the heat, etc. Thankfully there's AC literally everywhere indoors. If salary is good then I'd recommend moving there. If it's not so high then you'll struggle",india
[deleted],india
"I’ve lived in Dubai for 16+ years now. All points are true. Like in India, there are different levels of living in Dubai. You can be real frugal or splurge all your salary.  

Cost of living is pretty high, let’s say 30-40% higher than metros in India. Although you pay no income tax, the costs of accommodation, food, schools will take up most of your income. 

Keep a clear goal on what you want to achieve. I came here without any goal. 

Job market is super competitive and there are no clear employment guidelines. There are companies which scam employees. There are companies which don’t pay salary on time. Having said that there are also opportunities for right talent, specifically experts in supply chain. 

Understand that Dubai is predominantly consumer society and reexport hub. Small percentage of products are manufactured here but increasing day by day. 

If you’re inclined towards business, there are good opportunities. Start up costs are steep. But you will make it up in your business. 

All the best with your move.",india

"The rule of law is even less of a thing than it is in India. India has a constitution and is in  name at least a democracy. The UAE is an absolute monarchy like in the days of yore and doesn't even pretend to have any democratic representation.

Combine this with the aforementioned lack of citizenship possibilities and know that you are ALWAYS dependant on the whims of some despots in the UAE. And this is society's design by choice.

"ADDED TO THIS

**Pro of Groceries**: Dubai gets the first class of India's exported groceries and at cheaper rate than India. Once when tomatos were being sold for Rs 110+ in India at that same time it was being sold for 2 AED i.e Rs. 42 in UAE at carrefour, lulu and small groceries.

**Pro of Quality**: Anything here is tested to be used, even a small thing like power adapter doesn't get a license to sell unless it gets quality assurance from government. In India they just sell any cheap chinese things that literally burn out in a week.

**Pro of Rental Laws (extended law and order):** We got rental increase of 20% from real estate company but law here dictates that they have to give notice 3 months prior to renewal. We were scared as the amount was huge so we approached Land Dept. and they advised to file case, within 7 days it came in our favor and judge took a print out of last years contract, over wrote on dates and stamped it, told me ""take this order and show it to anyone who tell you to vacate, even the police wont touch you"" and believe me after 3-4 months in new year the real estate company was running around us to collect the same old amount, we gave that though as per law. Also to add, one cannot suddenly increase rent more than 20% without 3 months notice, nor force vacate a tenant without 12 months notice, and provide all basic amenities needed for safe living. This also applies for peace of mind of owners, tenants also have to let know of non renewal 2 months prior of expiry of contract. Plus land value and property values are regulated, tenants can check on RERA website of how much rent should be hence they don't over pay.",india
"I have a similar experience as you too OP, having moved to Dubai from Delhi about 9 months back.

On the AQI part, I tend to disagree as even though the air quality isn't on par with European countries, it is slight vastly better than Indian metros like Delhi and Mumbai.

There is obviously a huge discrepancy in salaries offered in UAE, so one should definitely do their research on the cost of living expenses. 
Another thing to add is that medical insurance here is a must because medical expenses can be extreme. But generally if your employer is a reputed company, the insurance is pretty good and covers most expenses.",india

"Dubai and other Islamic countries, like Malaysia, do not offer permanent residence or citizenship. They typically provide long-term visas, but the certainty of renewal is always in question. Dubai is largely a desert country with limited natural water resources. Their wealth historically came from oil reserves, but with the global shift towards renewable energy, this advantage is diminishing. Consequently, they are now focusing on real estate, attracting high-net-worth individuals with the promise of tax-free living. However, it’s uncertain if this tax-free status will continue indefinitely. If policies change unfavorably, you might find yourself needing to relocate again, which can be destabilizing.

In contrast, our Self-Sustainable City offers a solid investment opportunity with a promising future. Governments worldwide are increasingly supporting sustainable initiatives, and this project aligns with these global trends.

If in India, the cops would’ve extorted money from my friend by trying to foist cases on the friend. However, in Dubai, The cops ran an investigation and in 48 hours my friend’s passport was back with him & he didn’t spend any time going to police station or any such thing. They had taken the passport away as a deposit in case there was some wrong doing. 

At the same time, a colleague’s son got mixed up with drug related stuff & was really tortured before being deported. They take drug related offenses quite seriously. Even there, the cops didn’t take money to shut the case off or no harassment of the family members like it would be in India.",india

I live in Dubai and this is just stereotypical and probably influenced  by the western media. 

There is absolute rule of law, and most people follow it because the repercussions are higher (higher fines, risk of deportation, etc.). 

And the government is a lot more efficient than it is in India. To give some example, last week I raised a complaint to the Municipality (called Civil Defense here) about people blocking fire exits in my apartment with stuff. Today I see everything has been cleared and the management has posted a notice.

You can rent apartment as we do in any major city, different price range, depending on the area, make of the building, size of the apartment etc. Some people do stay in shared apartments, which is also called bed spaces but, that's the very low cost accommodation option.

"Build your Linkedin network specifically with people who work in your field in UAE or any other target country, reach out to recruiters of your field who are based in your target country, they will sometimes charge you for their services but, sometimes they will help if the requirement is urgent and you suit the role. Invest in Linkedin premium, that thing pays for itself, specifically if you are in a job search mode, it let's you send messages and CVs to people directly without them being your connection. Make profiles on regional job portals, for UAE they are Bayt, Naukrigulf, Gulftalent etc. Keep your CV up to date and in the format as required in the region. Don't give up even if you don't hear back from people, keep sending your CVs and messages to atleast 10 people a day, till you land something substantial. I am not from marketing but, these general tips should help. And do your research about what kind of roles UAE or any target country has for your qualification, so you can tweak your CV to fit those roles. Also, certifications, if they apply to your field, do them, it helps to build your profile.",india

"That's because your typical consultancy companies won't pay as good as other US companies, and your friend needs to stop thinking he should have a bunda lifestyle.

"Not downplaying the discrimination but there is also the fact that back home the value of money considering the purchasing power parity is different. Business is aware of this situation and this is a reason why pays are made according to your passports and not race. For example- An Indian origin with Canadian passport will be paid equivalent to expats - this is my experience in the engineering consultancy field. However an Indian would be paid 30% lesser. There is also the fact that lot of that money is send back to India as remittance while expats spend money in ME, save less and remittance is low. Money comes back to the economy.",india

My friend, who was a Pakistani, and now is a Canadian, gets offered around 30 to 40 percent more as a base pay when he applies for jobs now, than what he did a couple of years ago (when he was Pakistani).

"I understand where you are coming from but there is a sense of hope, of possibility that India can become more democratic. As per the democracy index India is classified as a flawed democracy. For sure the state of democracy has deteriorated over the last couple of years, but there is still a democratic framework in play in India. Agree with him or not, but India still has someone like Shashi Tharoor as an MP in parliament, addressing issues and openly criticizing the ruling government.

All these things are not possible by design in the UAE. There is no true freedom as nothing is in essence set in stone, you live while your fate is not guaranteed by any democratic institution at all. Again, I  agree with you that things in India aren't good  either but there is more openness by all accounts, as is also deemed by political scientists. There is still more possible because there is a flawed democratic rule of law in India.",india
"It's not based on stereotypes or whatsoever but based on legal definitions and political science. 

The principle of the 'rule of law' is  that the law applies equally to everyone and everything. That may be an individual or company or an institute, any entity whatsoever. Key here is that in a democratic society the rule of law also applies to the state and its various actors. For example, if a government decides something it can be checked by the judiciary if such an act would be against the law. Furthermore the laws have a democratic mandate as a democratically elected parliament writes laws. Checks and balances like this form the basis of the Trias politica, the effective split between the executive, legislative and judiciary branches of government. It curbs authoritarianism as the executive can't do whatever it wants, it's being kept in check by other branches of government. This forms the basis of democratic societies.

In the UAE there are no effective checks and balances. The executive is by design not being hold in check by a legislative with a democratic mandate. There is no democratic mandate in the UAE, and the laws are being put in place by the executive power. In more concrete words; the executive can do whatever it wants without being kept in check by democratic procedures. This can easily lead to tyranny, which we often see happening in similar non-democratic nations (China, Russia,Saudi Arabia etc.). An example applying to the UAE for instance is the at-random possibilities of the executive to stiffle free speech. There is no power to keep that authority in check, giving the state the possibility to apply freedom of speech whenever they deem it fitting. 

I am not judging you for living in the UAE or preferring that choice over other places. You do you. And I understand the reasoning as well, given that it can provide lucrative opportunities for some people. And I also understand that society can be kept orderly as you describe it, an authoritatian state does not necessarily need to be a free-for-all. But denying that the UAE is an authoritatian state is just false.",india

I just gave a different perspective. There are several engineers who will grab a job for lesser salary because they can afford to and it provides better pay than the paltry salary they get back home. They do the maths and so do others! Maybe if India paid a labourer a minimum wage equivalent to other glorified jobs, this would be different. If expats get more salary, there is a market dynamics that is at play. They also have to pay taxes back in their country which fortunately Indians do not.",india

In her school, she was being paid 20 percent less than an Irish teacher who was just a grade 2 math teacher. The Irish teacher just had a bachelor's degree and around 2.5 years of experience, with zero experience in Dubai.

Also, my cousin was harassed for over 3 months when she quit her job. Even when she did it during her probation period while the Irish teacher was given a farewell and a goodie kit when she left abruptly in the middle of the year. She was not even asked a reason. Meanwhile, my cousin was verbally abused and they threatened legal action. Of course nothing happened because she was in the right legally, but yeah.

"I don't know if any of you have heard about this at all or not, but I'll describe the situation anyway.

Recently, my school district (Jefferson County, Colorado, USA) proposed a change to the AP History curriculum in our district. The proposal would change materials taught in class so that all materials, ""promote citizenship, patriotism, essentials and benefits of the 
free enterprise system, respect for authority and respect for 
individual rights.""
Also, ""Materials should not encourage or condone civil 
disorder, social strife or disregard of the law.""

 The full proposal can be found here: http://www.boarddocs.com/co/jeffco/Board.nsf/files/9NYRPF6DED70/$file/JW%20PROPOSAL%20Board%20Committee%20for%20Curriculum%20Review.pdf

The students of my school district have been protesting this change greatly, as we believe it will lead to mass censorship of our education. Not many materials taught in an AP class fit the criteria given. We believe, however, that it is our right to know about our history. We need help getting this information out there. Media coverage is essential, and it seems that you would all have a lot to say about this.

A few stories by local papers can be found [here](http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_26588432/jeffco-high-school-students-plan-walk-out-their) and [here](http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_26601519/jeffco-school-board-curriculum-committee-idea-latest-divisive).

I was just studying a similar topic in my college history class that we are required to take in order to major in history.

Although this is a *new* venue for the changes to take place, it is not a novel idea.  In 1988 British Parliament started changing, or creating (as they were previously non-existent), school teaching curriculum and standards. Obviously every subject had some sort of controversial issues to be debated about teaching or not teaching, but history specifically had core issues.  The issue was political in nature -- the conservative/traditionalists believed that patriotism should be at the center of attention in the history curriculum, while modernists/progressives believed more in the fair teachings, of civil unrest, war, political and internal problems, ect.

In the early 90s, 92, 93, 94, the US history curriculum went through similar issues. A large board of history teachers, professors and the like was created by the US to establish new standards in teaching. When they were finally taken to the legislators, they were thrown back, because the teachings were too progressive, and did not focus on patriotism, pro-US ideas, and instead on too many negative events.

The standards had to be revised/re-written, and compromise between historical professionals and *politicians* had to be made.

"It's not who you would expect! CLD actually has done a rating of the different RTI systems in the world, available at www.RTI-Rating.org, which shows that the best laws are from Serbia, Slovenia and India. India in particular is worth checking out, due to the transformative impact that law has had on the relationship between individuals and their governments.

All laws are flawed in some ways, but there are ""gold standards"" in the form of model legislation. The OAS has a model law on access to information here: http://www.oas.org/dil/access_to_information_model_law.htm, and there's another good one by Article 19, an NGO, here: http://www.article19.org/data/files/medialibrary/1796/model-freedom-of-information-law.pdf.",IAmA

Have a look at the Tshwanee Principles (http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/publications/global-principles-national-security-and-freedom-information-tshwane-principles) which elaborate this issue in great detail. Obviously when a real national security interest is engaged, it trumps the right to know. But there are a number of subtleties to this. First, international law recognises a public interest override, whereby even if a national security interest is engaged, if the overall public interest would be served by disclosure, that should dominate (so the NSA revelations would be an example of that). Second, government's often claim national security interests even when there are none, so claims need to be carefully scrutinised.",IAmA

The only way the situation would actually be hopeless is if people succumb to those feelings and accept the status quo.

There are a lot of NGOs active in the US to fight these issues - CDT, the EFF, the ACLU - who you can support through your time or money.

I have, however, been in a few countries where there are security risks (e.g. Afghanistan and Iraq).

Re. your second question, we are based in Canada. I think there are now enough local (i.e. US-based groups) engaged on the NSA issue that hopefully something will move. However, it is a very difficult one because this is an issue where the civil rights groups are a very long way away from government and the security people in terms of what they thing should be done. 

On the third, the idea of ""safety of the American people"" is far too vague ego justify withholding information and it also has a strong paternalistic flavour to it. But, as I said in an earlier post, it is legitimate to withhold certain information for national security purposes. 

Hard to say on your last question and I'm not quite sure what you mean by 'government' secrets (e.g. hiding corruption?) For me, secrets are legitimate only where they protect private interests (privacy, for example) or public interests (like national security) but not government interests (the government does not have interests other than those of the people). Otherwise, lots of governments have lots of secrets, both legitimate and illegitimate. ",IAmA

Since the Snowden revelations, the NSA has actually faced a huge surge in FOI requests over the past year - and the greater scrutiny will certainly have an impact on policy.

There can be legitimate reasons to keep information secret. Of course I shouldn't be allowed to get the names of undercover drug informants. But generally these exceptions are massively overused to hide mundane or embarrassing information.",IAmA

1) A lot more Snowdens from a lot more countries. The US has a strong culture of whistleblowing but this is a lot weaker in many other countries.

As Michael says, he is a hero who has sparked massive human rights debates in countries around the world (and continues to do so, of course, with his ongoing revelations).

Re. your second question, we probably need to look more closely at what you mean by 'negative'. But, in general, it is the primary author who should be responsible for leaking secrets. If you look at the US cables leaks, you will notice that Bradley Manning was convicted in the US, but that Julian Assange was never charged, even though he was really the one who distributed the information. This follows the theory that it is up to government to protect its secrets.

Every journalist or source has their own bias - both institutional and personal. In my mind, the key is to understand that bias and read everything through that filter. So, for example, I find that the Economist can provide really good insight, but you have to read it knowing that they're highly pro-business and free market orientated - and that the reporting is going to reflect that.

Edited: It can also be useful to read multiple sources. So, for example, if you know about the Israel-Palestian conflict - read about the same event in Al Jazeera, Haaretz and the Jerusalem Post, and you'll get a much better understanding of what's going on than if you rely on just one.",IAmA

In Africa, the latest wave of access to information laws though tend to extend the right of information to private bodies as well (south Africa, Liberia, etc.) - which is serious progress. The call for the responsibilities of private bodies to be transparent must also be a call we make when trying to promote open data as well.

That's why some types of cases will be judge alone trials,  and some won't.  As  you'd expect,  in  a judge alone trial the  judge is the decision-maker, who will tend to apply legal principles in making their decisions. Typical examples are low level criminal cases (involving the police) , and all almost all civil cases (when you sure someone). 

Conversely, juries are seldom legally trained and make decisions based off their values and principles. This is the point of a jury.   Of course  where necessary the judge will explain the legal tests to find someone guilty (e.g.  Battery is the least touching in anger without implied or express consent). But it's up to the jury.

Also, legal advocacy and evidence textbooks will actually teach you that for judge trials, your opening statements should be short and full of legal words if it makes the reading quicker.   But for Jury trials you're to appeal to their emotions wherever possible and use normal language.  And is body language more. 
American textbooks and teachers will actually suggest you manipulate the system wherever possible.  Which is fucked up. 

There's a long history behind juries,  dating back to the ancient Greeks or maybe older. 

But basically law is said to be the reflection of society's values,  so what better way than to apply these values to a case. 

Also,  by no means is this a flaw or loophole, it's extremely rare that this would happen.  Also keep in mind that the area hundreds of other rules and laws that ensure fairness etc. 

TLDR: it's an intended quirk of law,  seldom (if ever) used,  and circumscribed by plenty of other law. 

P. S.  South Africa don't have juries, just a judge.  So Oscar pistorious just got convicted of manslaughter without a jury.  Now THAT'S weird. ",IAmA

"Implementation is always an issue/ Part of the solution is bringing the public on board to constantly using a law to drive use and force better implementation.

And this means constant and active vigilance from citizens, civil society and state actors.",IAmA
"Yes. Yes I do. In RSA we have an access to information law, but the actual credence given to transparency is not strong. I worry that it is not only a result of a government that prefers secrecy (or, obviously, finds it easier), but that that instinct is related to the problem that the South African population is becoming increasingly apathetic about demanding answers from their government.",IAmA

"Of course, access to information is not an absolute right. It could be legally restricted for the protection of certain interests. One may see an exhaustive list of access exemptions in the Council of Europe Convention on Access to Official Documents (Art.3, para.1):
a. national security, defence and international relations;
b. public safety;
c. the prevention, investigation and prosecution of criminal activities;
d. disciplinary investigations;
e. inspection, control and supervision by public authorities;
f. privacy and other legitimate private interests;
g. commercial and other economic interests;
h. the economic, monetary and exchange rate policies of the state;
i. the equality of parties in court proceedings and the effective administration of Justice;
j. environment; or 
k. the deliberations within or between public authorities concerning the examination of a matter.
You may find a similar list under Art.4 of the Aarhus Convention (which guarantees access to environmental information) or in the EU Regulation 1049/2001 on access to official documents of the EU institutions. What is more important is that the exemptions are subject to assessment under a three-part test, which means that they may apply only if the following 3 elements are together in place as regards any application of exemption:
- provided by law;
- for the purpose of protection of the listed interests (strictly and proportionally applied);
- it is necessary in a democratic society. 
Furthermore, an exemption could be applied only if 1) there could be real harm and 2) there is not an overriding public interest in the disclosure.

In my mind though, the comparisons to the US are natural, rather that the result of a concerted policy.

"First, I think we have to be very honest and accept that, for all its flaws, the US government is more open than the Canadian one. As we have stated before, the Canadian law is very outdated and implementation is weak. 

On the more general point about 'terrible' and 'corrupt' I guess it is hard to say. Certainly the Canadian government (and Canadians in general) are happy to point south when there are problems there (e.g. the NSA surveillance) and say we are doing better. But I am always suspicious of that and we certainly cannot say our government is innocuous (it wields a lot of power even if it doesn't play the global role the US does.

"So this is something that has been discussed a bit down the list. Basically, there are, under international law, three requirements for governments to refuse access to information:

1) It relates to a category of potentially secret information (national security, privacy, etc. - there are 8-10 types of information recognised as needing protection).

2) The release of the information would be likely to cause harm to that interest (i.e. it is not all information relating to national security but only information that, if it were disclosed, would harm national security). 

3) Even if there is a risk of harm, the information should still be released if, on balance, this would be in the public interest. An example might be the purchase of a new weapons system, which involved bribery of officials or some other form of corruption. 

Taken together, this is a fair balance between the need for secrecy and the need for openness, which works well when applied properly. The problem is that most governments treat far too much information as secret (even when it does not really relate to one of those interests or would not cause harm if release or there is a good public interest reason for releasing it).",IAmA
"No, I don't. I'm not really into conspiracy theories. And one of the reasons openness is so important is to provide a more solid base for what we can believe.

"Sure - there are exceptions to the right to information, and information which the government legitimately should be keeping under wraps. I mentioned earlier about the names of police informants or undercover officers. But the only information which should be withheld is that which would cause real harm to a legitimate interest and where withholding the information serves a greater public good. As it stands, every government in the world withholds far more than would be permitted under that standard.",IAmA
"I certainly believe there are exceptions to transparency (see my detailed comment on this a bit down - maybe search on 'override' to find it). But I think it is important to distinguish systems. You have a right to ask and be given information held by public bodies, subject to exceptions. These will always cover the sorts of things you mention above. But there is also protection for whistleblowers who only need to show that they are releasing information on a matter of public interest (and so the exceptions don't apply in the same way). Snowden is one of the latter. We don't require whistleblowers to undertake a careful evaluation of harm and public interest balancing; they are not qualified to do this. We simply require them to identify wrongdoing and expose it. In this way, whistle blowing is a sort of information safety valve and not a carefully calibrated system. Hope that makes sense.",IAmA

How do you respond to the claim that Snowden did not reveal any unlawful or surprising behavior?

The US is a representative democracy, and as such appoints individuals to make decisions regarding intelligence operations, national security, etc... If our representatives are operating under and within their mandate, as Snowden has in fact shown they were, why do you use the term whistleblowing?

I've followed these developments quite closely, and have yet to see any evidence of wrong doing or exceeding of authority except in certain cases of individual malfeasance (LOVEINT, for example) which were apparently corrected.

Whistleblowing may be a last check on government abuse, but is not the cause of whistleblowing undermined when individuals like this are celebrated?

His revelations may have been of note to citizenry around the world, but the US citizenry was informed in 2004 and 2005 of the US' warrantless wiretapping programs under Article 2 Executive powers, and then in gave its consent in 2008 when the FAA was passed.

Internally, the supporters of personal data protection (PDP) in Europe raised the issue of the level of the legal PDP protection here and especially of the grounds and cases in which police and security services are allowed to access retained electronic data (such as e.g. traffic data). As a result, in April 2014 the EU Court of Justice declared invalid the Directive on data retention (Directive 2006/24/EC) which obliged EU states to ensure retention of traffic data for 6-24 months with the purpose to provide access by police and secret services to combat serious crimes.

Why is it not acceptable that Americans have basically decided they do not need to be informed of their governments actions and behaviors? Consent to be governed does not require informed consent. I really am curious because I've just never understood this ideology that you guys are espousing. Even if our government were abusing the population (which I don't think it is) or inefficient (which it may be) it seems to be doing a good job outcompeting other governments, and if it fails in doing so the inefficiency will be exposed or need to be rectified as other competing nations succeed over it. So why exactly do I need to know? Or need a right to know?

Also, I would be careful when appealing to the UN for authority on any concept. The structure of a Security Council with five permanent members, with veto powers, delegitimizes it as a valid authority on well, anything, so when people say well the UNDHR or the HRC or a Special Rapporteur, or the ICJ etc... I just kind of laugh and think... that's cute; our tanks say no.

I bring this up because its ultimately the people who control these tanks and similar who you need to convince to cede power and authority in order for you to achieve your goals. In the past, with things like civil rights, transitions to democracies, moves away from colonialism to client states and soft power, there have been fundamentally strong arguments, and I'm curious if there are similar ones here, because no one's shown them to me yet.",IAmA

Firstly, absurdly broad interpretations of existing laws do not make warrantless mass spying lawful, especially in the domestic realm. Secondly, any law that would permit such an action is still itself contrary to the Constitution, and as such that law would be null and void from its inception. 

Thirdly, an action doesn't gain legitimacy as a mere consequence of no one being ""surprised"" by it. No would be surprised by a convicted thief robbing a purse, but that doesn't in any way mitigate his actions.

> The US is a representative democracy, and as such appoints individuals to make decisions regarding intelligence operations, national security, etc... If our representatives are operating under and within their mandate, as Snowden has in fact shown they were...

The decisions those individuals make on our behalf must fall within the scope of the Constitution, above all else. Snowden exposed actions which are arguably egregiously unconstitutional. Today, no amount of legislative action can make the owning of another human being constitutional. It would be legal, but the unconstitutionality of the law would not be in doubt.

> I've followed these developments quite closely, and have yet to see any evidence of wrong doing or exceeding of authority except in certain cases of individual malfeasance...

The act of mass domestic spying itself is the malfeasance. General warrants are unconstitutional. Searches and seizures absent probable cause are unconstitutional. The chilling of speech mass spying creates is unconstitutional. 

Your argument here boils down to: ""So what if this guy is recording all these little kids taking baths? He's not watching the video. He's not distributing any pictures. He's not molesting them. What's so wrong about it?""

And even here, you're likely very wrong. As courts grant individuals standing in cases against the NSA we will all see their true actions.

The problem is, that if something is legal, there's no basis for ""whistleblowing"" within a democratic system. Individual's don't get to set policy because they disagree with something, and the very fact that it was done by the people who make the laws and were elected to do so, makes it correct.

>Secondly, any law that would permit such an action is still itself contrary to the Constitution, and as such that law would be null and void from its inception.

No it isn't. Not unless the Courts say it is. The combination of the AUMF, the PATRIOT Act, and FISA Amendments create a very strong legislative framework and no clear constitutional challenge.

You could potentially get FAA immunity invalidated on some form of constructive 1st Amendment challenge, but then likely the telecoms would be pressured simply not to make such contracts with individuals. Again, this is unlikely and standing only applies to a very narrow set of arguments.

Remember, only the telecoms are being searched, not individuals, and there's a whole reasonableness issue.

>Thirdly, an action doesn't gain legitimacy as a mere consequence of no one being ""surprised"" by it. No would be surprised by a convicted thief robbing a purse, but that doesn't in any way mitigate his actions.

In a democracy it absolutely does gain legitimacy. Silence indicates consent and frankly, I feel the public should be estopped from these complaints.

>The decisions those individuals make on our behalf must fall within the scope of the Constitution, above all else.

>Snowden exposed actions which are arguably egregiously unconstitutional.

There is little to no evidence of this. The Constitutional argument I see as remotely possible existed prior to Snowden based on the public passing of telecom immunity itself.

>Today, no amount of legislative action can make the owning of another human being constitutional. It would be legal, but the unconstitutionality of the law would not be in doubt.

What? I mean, that would be exceeding their mandate. I specifically used the words operating under and within a mandate. This statement is irrelevant to my arguments.

>The act of mass domestic spying itself is the malfeasance.

No such thing; it wasn't done.

>General warrants are unconstitutional.

The warrants are not general, FISC and FISC-R have upheld them. SCOTUS will likely uphold, but until they say otherwise, the warrants are not general and they are constitutional.

>Searches and seizures absent probable cause are unconstitutional.

No. The search must be reasonable. Also, the Executive develops probable cause for the warrants it receives against the telecoms; they possess credible information that terrorists are using the telecom's networks.

> The chilling of speech mass spying creates is unconstitutional.

The chilling effects argument is very difficult to make, and relies more on the effect of Congress preventing terms in contracts where people have a civil cause of action for loss of privacy; this has nothing to do with Snowden, but also, is not necessarily going to survive a challenge because of the low degree of intrusiveness of pen registers and metadata, the societal interest, and the lack of other means of developing this intelligence.

>Your argument here boils down to: ""So what if this guy is recording all these little kids taking baths? He's not watching the video. He's not distributing any pictures. He's not molesting them. What's so wrong about it?""

No it doesn't boil down to this at all; if you think that's what metadata is, you're woefully uninformed.

First, there is no reasonable expectation of privacy when using a locator device whose job it is to broadcast your position to someone else so that information can be forwarded to you.

Second, the NSA is not doing the recording, and the telecom is not even recording a video of the bath, it is writing down that the kid took a bath. Now, if you changed this from bath to went to the YMCA and went swimming every day, it is not illegal or wrong for someone to sit outside the YMCA and make these records.

>And even here, you're likely very wrong. As courts grant individuals standing in cases against the NSA we will all see their true actions.

SCOTUS will likely overturn the standing component.

>That's like saying military members shouldn't be given medals and lauded lest it affect have some magical negative consequence... Weird.

I think you've misunderstood the statement. It's not like saying this at all. I'm saying falsely applying the term whistleblower to simple criminals damages the cause of whistleblowing and weakens legitimate whistleblower protections.

>This is a flat out lie. You're conflating press reports with official government declarations.

Nope. Did you not read the FAA in 2008? Did you also not read Congressional statements, Presidential statements, expert analyses?

>Never were the American people informed by any branch of government, in unambiguous terms and outside of misdirecting laws with dubious secret legal interpretations, that they were all being spied on.

Because they're not being spied on. But they were informed in unambiguous terms that any data they shared with a major telecom would be subject to secret warrant. Third party doctrine destroyed, at least in mine and any other people's minds, the reasonable expectation of privacy which people could even assert for a 4th Amendment claim.

">Even if the broader public can not oversee, what of judicial oversight or parliamentary oversight through ad hoc committees?

I agree, but we would need to ask about the incentives involved in the parties moderating national security interests.  For example, would it be in the judiciary's interest to curtail overreaches of the executive branch?  Or would the it be mutually beneficial for each branch to support a broad understanding of national security?  I think a case could be made that any ruling which expands the power of the federal government would ultimately be in the interest of each branch that composes it.  

I like what you said about the people being the ultimate check on executive authority.  An active and aware citizenry is the only real answer against growing government power.  It is also worth mentioning, in passing, that *states* traditionally played a much more active role in American politics and were a more directly democratic voice than they are today.  The states, supported by the people, traditionally provided the best check on federal executive powers- since each state's power would decrease in proportion to the federal government's increase.  

The reduction of states to a politically administrative function has done a lot to assist the rise of an federal government intent on obfuscation and the accumulation of power.         ",IAmA

To me, this type of power cannot accrue in completely transparent environments, and the risk of hidden abuse is mitigated and outweighed by the stabilizing benefits.

Furthermore, I see the goal of the human project currently as being 1) reaching a transhuman stage, 2) getting off this planet.

Crying about it now isn't going to help you.""

Also, I greatly disagree that you can equate legality with moral correctness, or even with the will of the people. In many cases, governments campaign on one idea and then institute a completely different one once in power. That is not holding to the ideals of a functional democracy. When your current political body responsible for making law has [an approval rate of 14%](http://www.gallup.com/poll/1600/congress-public.aspx), I think you can safely say that what people voted for was not in actuality performed as was implied.

The **way the system is set up** also disagrees with you. The whole point of having an independent judiciary with the power to rule laws unconstitutional and strike them down is to recognize that the government will sometimes move beyond what is correct and just in creating legislation. It's an inherent understanding of the system that there needs to be a check for when that happens. The whole idea of whistleblowing is not just to out people who are performing illegal actions - Nixon's mass wiretapping of his political rivals could have been justified some way or another, he certainly considered it legal at the time and until Watergate nobody who knew questioned it - it's also to keep the government honest and to keep public scrutiny of serious governmental actions high.

I'm not even going to bother getting into other countries.

> Remember, only the telecoms are being searched, not individuals, and there's a whole reasonableness issue.

If the government were to start spying in on the contents of packages delivered through FedEx and UPS, they would still be spying on the sender and the recipient, *not* the carrier. And as evidenced by Yahoo!'s court challenge of the government's domestic spying apparatus, the government is coercing cooperation from these telecom's at the tune of a $250k fine **per day** if they refuse to be complicit in their crimes. 

There's is no measure of reasonableness in spying on hundreds of millions of innocent Americans just going about their lives. It is wholly unconstitutional, unAmerican, and despotic behavior.

> the Executive develops probable cause for the warrants it receives against the telecoms; they possess credible information that terrorists are using the telecom's networks

By that grossly unsound logic, if a terrorist made use of a highway, all cars on highways would thus automatically be subject to search on a single warrant. That is the height of absurdity. 

>  The chilling effects argument is very difficult to make

It's not difficult at all. A natural consequence of a person being watched is that they alter their behavior to not arouse anyone against them. Even when their behavior is perfectly within the law, the average person will not want to have their every choice, point of view, and thought process criticized and potentially misinterpreted in a manner that could bring them trouble. 

There is no such thing as ""just meta-data"". Meta-data *is* **the data**. It is the most important piece of the puzzle. I can glean far much more about you from your upvote/downvote history than I can from your comment history. And upvotes are just but one stream of meta-data.

First, that's *your* opinion. Secondly, that's sheer semantics. And thirdly, it is not just meta-data that is being collected. Phone calls are being recorded and emails, text messages, skype conversations are being stored. 

In another comment you said, and I quote: ""It's mostly the peasant class who are willfully ignorant or just naive"" in respect to the domestic spying that is going on. And you added: ""No idea how these laws could have been interpreted any other way.""

No, for a variety of reasons, though I was tempted to agree with you for hilarity's sake.

First, the reason the Vogon argument doesn't fly is because the people of Earth were not even aware of the existing galactic entity around them. There is an argument in that situation that ignorance is a defense. However, in the US, you are well aware of the US government, that it has laws, and that you are obliged to adhere to them even if you did not care to.

There is no defense of whistleblowing for national security topics or acts which are not illegal. Nixon's interesting, because his actions were in some cases private, and not illegal.

Pre-Snowden it did no such thing. The government under Bush and Obama continuously lied and covered up the extent of its actions regarding its illegal and unconstitutional domestic spying.

No you cannot. The government attempts to thwart all legal challenges by claiming the so called 'state secrets' privilege.

Yes. It was well written and contains direct citations.

>Here we have two powerful and resource rich organizations who vetted tens of thousands of documents with the help of lawyers and technical experts vs. some guy from 'zdnet', who has access to ZERO information.

Except the Washington Post retracted its story, and Greenwald began to equivocate rephrasing his story as about a discrepancy between the government and tech companies understandings and less about the direct access claim.

Read the article I linked and state what your objections to its claims are.

The ZDNet author had access to the same primary source documents Greenwald used to support his claims. Anyone with basic technological understanding can read these documents and know that they do not indicate PRISM has the ability to directly access the tech companies servers.

Greenwald is an unreliable journalist and more of a pundit / commentator. 

>Peasant class? You feel you're above your fellow Americans, don't you? The contempt is palpable.

It's a description. It's accurate. There's no contempt; that's on you.

>The only people saying ""so what?"" are authoritarians and they're on the wrong side of history.

Incorrect. I don't know who you speak to, but most of the educated liberal set also are saying so what.

>Pre-Snowden it did no such thing.


Of course, there's no reason for it to disclose these programs to its enemies. It's like telling the Germans we broke Enigma.

>The government under Bush and Obama continuously lied and covered up the extent of its actions regarding its illegal and unconstitutional domestic spying.

You have not established anything that was illegal or unconstitutional. You're just hand-waiving. Of course they would lie and obfuscate about what the capabilities are. You don't know how deep our submarines can dive either. The public has no right to this knowledge.

The reason they had to start disclosing was because absent appropriate context and accurate information from the Snowden documents, the blowback was growing and people were getting hysterical. They had to say something because Greenwald was basically making shit up and scaring the fuck out of people.

>FISA is a kangaroo court, through and through. It is there to rubber stamp any and all government actions, and in secret. It's the kind of court that would make any despotic regime proud.

Incorrect. And regardless of whether or not a Court is a kangaroo court, our Constitution allows for this type of Court.

>No you cannot. The government attempts to thwart all legal challenges by claiming the so called 'state secrets' privilege.

State Secrets doesn't prevent appeal.

>You're very purposefully spreading about disinformation (as is clear by your dubious link alone). And you're counting on those ""peasants"" not to do the follow up work that would show them you're both wrong on the facts and lying in your presentation of them.

That's ironic. I'd say that's what you're doing. You just waive around the terms illegal and unconstitutional, and haven't provided a single concrete claim or constitutional argument.

I'm actually encouraging people to read the primary source documents themselves, read the laws, read the newspaper articles published at the time, and inform themselves as to why this behavior makes sense.

But Police Officers are allowed to carry a gun around you.,IAmA
">You are saying political change risks the status quo; why does that risk humanity? 

Well, it depends on what your changes to the staus quo are. Transparency seems to be key to you, but a lot of non-transparent acts are what keep the world running; from behind the scenes bribery of foreign officials and propping up of regimes, to information about the nature of an actor's strength ie the Tunisian revolt.

Basically, I think that transparency would lead to the collapse of US structural hegemony, and without a superpower controlling and pacifying populations and governments, conflicts would emerge throughout the world and these might spread into and contaminate technology centers in the west. The US already has to actively combat these threats on a daily basis, and there is still spillover and blowback. We minimize it as much as possible, but if London, New York, Tokyo, San Francisco, etc... are destabilized we risk a thousand years of darkness as we rebuild to this technological state. We've actually seen some problems arise because of transparency in recent years; Wikileaks, the Snowden files, etc... these have been deeply damaging to US hegemony and the world is suffering.  

If we tried to go further and peacefully re-allocate resources to others in a more egalitarian fashion, current stakeholders would likely fight the process, and there would always be a discussion about what level of reallocation is fair, and still the latent resentment for past actions. We've interfered with so much of the rest of the world, we are unlikely to be treated well should we surrender our privilege.

>Your position presupposes, based on the rest of what you have stated, that the majority of people are privileged. 

No it does not. In fact it presupposes the opposite; that the vast majority of the world is unprivileged and would likely kill those with privilege given the opportunity to do so.

>I act from a place of privilege, in pursuit of a life that is better for the unprivileged - that you would not as you believe inactivity serves you better is fine, but the stauts quo (by definition) serves few.

And my question is why? Why do you care to act to improve the lives of a limited number of people alive today, at the risk of the future of our entire civilization and the un-told trillions which will be born in the future?

A few billion people living under poor conditions today is simply irrelevant in the scope of the future of our civilization, and we are at an inflection point where we can either push through to the point where we have the technology and resources to create better lives for everyone, or we can get distracted and risk losing everything trying to help a few people who will likely kill us given the opportunity.

My questions originally were:

>What if one benefits from the status quo?

>What is your argument for changing the status quo?

>What is better about your proposed alternative system?

And I still feel like I don't have clear answers... it appears to me because you have a moral value system of helping other people? Is that correct?

Also, why are you the only one who has responded to any of my questions? Others like Michael Karinicolas has not responded to me in the entirety of his 8 hours of being online answering questions. I asked him a few very straightforward and basic questions and he has answered with nothing.",IAmA
"Awesome, finally a real discussion.

>I believe historical models that demonstrate a balance of resources with a preference for human capital.

You believe such models are more accurate when modeling past events? Or that such an approach would be more optimal?

For example, while I don't ultimately disagree with the future implementation of collapse theories, I think we exist at a time where risking collapse is unnecessary and unwise.

I also don't think that hegemonic stability theory is necessarily incompatible with collapse theories, or historical Marxism. There can be benefit from collapses and reorganizations and the creation of new hegemons, and then those new hegemons preside over periods of stability and growth.

The question to me when considering initiating a collapse is, does it make sense to do it? And for me, now would be a really stupid time to do it.

>In short, this has been bullet points about why access to information and social freedoms cause surplus as a result of unfettered human enginuity.

>Taken together, the fruits of our undivided labor would RISE standards of living for all, instead of rob the privileged of their deserved resources.

I think the carrying capacity of the planet is lower than our current population, as are the labor requirements of our given stage of civilization.

I think a switch at this point would be unwise and unnecessarily risky. A major feature of ""replicator"" type civilizations like the The Federation, involve significantly fewer resource and energy constraints than currently exist. I think that within 100 years we might have the technology to move toward a fairer civilization, but I don't think we have it now.

>Especially regarding your love of futurist science, you should be aware that the next brainchild could be anywhere, including foreign countries.

If you look at the average purchasing power of an Indian in the target demographic (students, young working professionals); they will be ready to pay a bundle price of say 4000 VP (not too bad, sacrifice one video game purchase for a bundle).  However, your purchase penetration will easily go up to ~40-50% GUARANTEED.  New revenue; 2,500,000 players= 4000 VP= 10bn VP of revenue, or nearly a 2.2x growth.

">Also, Rito, why does NA have the update quicker than APAC or EU? Despite the latter being ahead in the timezones as well?

You can't guess how salty I feel about this.

Why do I have to wait for 2AM in Europe (Berlin time) for my shop to be updated. Like, USA has timezones too. It's not that hard to reset the shop at 8 AM or something.

Same goes with Nightmarkets! Why was the announcement for the last one day later for Europe? It's not that hard to put it one day earlier than NA, same with Australia. I wouldn't mind if they got the NM earlier.

Rito are so damn entitled to NA is annoying. PBE is not even available in EU for fucks sake.

If I hate one thing about this company, it's their biasing towards NA. Just because they are one day later, I don't have to wait one day too.

It's 28th right now in Europe, I thought the announcement was on 27th?

The Masters is I guess ok, still mad I missed the Player Card, because the final was at 4AM (UK time)",VALORANT

"Yeah because you're not the target audience. The simple fact you said: ""see the price"" means you're not the one who they're selling skins to. The ones who pay the bills are those who just click on the buy button whenever there's literally anything new. New agent? Buy it. New battlepass? Get it and get all the tiers, don't wanna miss that knife at the end! New bundle? Gonna get it, try it out and see if I like any of the skins or variants. Need RP? Yeah whatever just get the biggest bundle. 

Those are the people droping 100s or 1000s monthly in the game and they keep riot running. People buying 1-2 skins or maybe a bundle and then never anything again are just there so whales don't play an empty game. If you're not buying everything (or almost everything) Riot doesn't care if you spend money or not, they only want you to populate the servers so whales will keep buying (or so that whales feel good about their purchase when you compliment their skin or someone asks for them to drop a skin). 

Of course do keep in mind that I'm talking about the business and management people, the devs probably have absolutely 0 say in the monetisation model and are just there to make the best game they can! (also replay feature when?)",VALORANT

"They base things off NA times for patches and stuff because they're in NA. Specifically, they release patches (full patches like the new act and the patch that opens night market) at the start of their working hours in LA. The reason being that when there are bugs, devs are already on hand to fix them because they're in the office for work already. I don't think that argument works as well for the store reset, but it's probably easier logistically to have it work the same way. Ends at the end of the American workday. 

PBE thing is weird, but I know nothing about it cause I'm not in it. Only a very small amount of people actually get let in, it's not like every player in NA gets access. What I do know is that it's only sometimes open. So maybe it's only open at certain times too? Again Idrk anything about it. 

Masters is based on the timezone it's played in, and they'll move start times earlier or later a little bit depending on the region to attempt to find a sweet spot of a time that allows the most people to watch. Masters Tokyo was the first event that was bad for EU and NA time-wise. Finals started at almost 1am for me in the eastern US and 4am for you in the UK. Neither NA or EU players can really complain too much because other than Berlin for parts of NA, the times have been pretty manageable for the most part for us and it's been Asia really getting screwed over by it. Some games may have gone late for EU, but better to be late for most of the viewer base and it was by no means as late as some of the Tokyo start times for the US.",VALORANT

"Blame a company for profiting of cosmetics for a free to play game? 

People are currently buying the skins. They are making money hand over foot on the amount of skins being bought currently. Why would they lower price when the demand is so high?",VALORANT
"\^ This. 

By having prices that people are not willing to pay, you push them to look for a cheaper alternative(ie. vpn exploits). 

This in turn fucks everyone up. 

In tthe end the prices are simply too high. 

The only way to rectify this, is for the community to stop buying at the set price. 

But people have so little self control that for every boycotter like me, there are 100 people if not 1000s that will gladly pay the current prices. 

Supply and Demand - As long as there is demand, they have no incentive to lower the price. 

Since skins are a one and done thing(initial design/implementation cost)  - There is no reason why they can'tt adjust the prices.

Think about it from their standpoint. They are a business. When deciding on price of a service/good, a business will consider what the cost is to them, then what the consumer is willing to pay for the good. 

If They lets say find out that people are willing to pay 100 bucks for a bundle, they will charge 100 bucks for a bundle. 

If they release a bundle for 100 bucks and another bundle at 50 bucks, and the sales figures are split 80/20(80% buy 100 buck bundle) - They will release 100 buck bundle. Since the cost to them is the same regardless if the skin is 100 or 50 bucks. Now lets say they work out that development cost can be recouped after 10k sales @ 50bucks(development cost being 50k). Anything after that is 50bucks profit per sale. 

Now lets say they release a bundle thats 100$ and the dev cost to the company is double because it's more complicated skin(ie. effects etc. need to be animated/coded/designed). Now to recoup they need need to sell 10k @ 100 bucks. anything after that is 100$ profit. 

You would need to sell the cheaper skin 2:1 to make the same profits. 

Riot obviously did they data research and have found that cheaper skins, do not outself the 100 buck skin bundles 2:1. Therefore their cheaper skins are not worth it. They would rather drop the price of the skins in a bundle(night market) once in a while, since all the skins in night market are pure profit(as the sales when they released initially covered the cost already). 

Now You might say, yes but if there are no 50 buck skin bundles, some people just wont buy at all. And you would be right to an extent. 

Lets say we have 100 people willing to buy 50$ bundle. That's 5000 bucks for riot. Let's say the dev cost is half that (2500). 

Riot drops the 50$ bundle in favour of 100$ bundle. 

Out of those 100 people 1/4 bitch about it and buy the more expensive skin bundle. Another 1/2 say fuck it and refuse to buy the bundle at all. The remaining 1/4 are on the fence and are saying lets wait and see. 

that 1/4  will bring in 2500 alone. 1/4 that were on the fence then further split 50/50 and 50% of that 1/4 gives into it and buys it(because they like the skin/want to impress someone whatever the reason). Thats an additional 1250$ for riot. 

So total sales 3750. 

You might say, see, lower price, more sales, more profit. Yes, BUT;

Riot releases some of those skins from both bundles at a discount. Lets go crazy and say the discount for the 100$ bundle skins is 50% and the 50$ is only 10%. 

Riot is still making 50% profit on that 100$ skin once it's in the night market. 

Riot is making 90% profit on that 50% skin bundle. 

For simplicity sake I'm pretending night market does skin bundles; So per night market skin sold, the cheaper bundle is netting me 45$, the More expensive Bundle is netting 50$. 

Now based on human psychology and statistics, they figured that Big number discounts are more likely to convert to sale. 

Since after a certain point all skins are pure profit, the base price being higher, means that even with a discount, they are making more profit than the sale price of a cheaper skin bundle. 

They look at the stats, peoples purchase habits, and sales trends, and then decide what's a price they can charge.

Now in reality, the operational cost needs to be taken into account, but they make their money from BP/Agent unlocks too, and they don't ever drop an items price by 50% or more, and 1/2 of people don't refuse to buy a skin bundle cause they are unhappy. 

With the number of redittors here compared to number of players, even if every single person on this reddit boycotted skins, there would be more than enough people that would keep buying skins, leading to minimal revenue loss for Riot. 

The bottom line is that Business wants to make profit above everything else. Because if you don't make profit you can't operate, and if you can't operate, you don't have a business. 

Each business regardless of the nature of the business, will have a level of tolerence for customer satisfaction, and as long as that number is low enough, they don't bother with changing anything. It's only you threaten the profits that your complaint is heard. That or your business is likely to get sued due to malpractice(breaking tax laws, breaking gambling laws etc.)

&#x200B;

As long as the playerbase as a whole are paying, it doesn't matter if they are unhappy. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now I'm way over simplifying this, I'm not taking into account running costs etc. but the idea is still there. Sell Lower Volume at higher price, reduce the reliancy on units sold, since there is no manufacturing cost after the initial design, higher price means more profits long term.",VALORANT

"Except Riot doesn't care about those who just buy 1 or 2 bundles. They only care about whales, those people who buy ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING, not even looking at what they're spending. They don't look at people who will buy the 50$ bundle. They don't look at people who will buy the 100$ bundle. They look at the people that will buy both and the next one at 110, insta buy the whole battlepass and agents, etc. etc. the only reason they have the cheaper bundles is so whales can flex their expensive ones on them and so people who aren't whales keep on playing the game so it isn't empty only to sell stuff to whales.

They don't sell cheaper skins to make profit out of them, those who look at the price of skins and buy them depending on it, buy their favorite skin for each gun they use and that's it, they don't buy again, they don't care about them, that money is a drop in the water. They only care about those who buy absolutely anything and everything that comes out, and the only reason why they care about the other people is that whales don't play an empty game.

Why do you think RP exists? I've been playing for a while, I have a phantom, vandal and a knife, I unlocked all their variants and I have RP to spare, it's so those who buy EVERYTHING spend EVEN MORE, while the people who don't, get a skin or two and keep playing the game to populate the servers so they can make money from whales.",VALORANT
"This is all good info, but I think you're focusing too much on bundles. Nobody buys the $50 bundles because they always suck- I agree. What people do buy, though, are all the $17-$22 single weapon skins rotating through the shop that ARE still cool on their own, and maybe they would sell more if they were a bit cheaper. For me, paying $17 for one skin is a stretch, but I did it. However, I really really really don't feel encouraged to get another one because of the price. I think if they were something like $10 and maybe $15 for the high-end ones, there would be a lot more people buying not only at least one, but multiples. Their main target seems to be the people who just buy everything, though, so an overall high price on every item becomes very profitable",VALORANT

"Nowhere did I say that I’m better than you, or that I’d be able to price it better than you. Only thing I said is that Riot knows what they’re doing, and if they chose this pricing it because data tells them this is how they get the most money",VALORANT
"ask Modi, he'd probably agree with Riot and that guy",VALORANT
Ya sizes of 'whales' are also different in different regions or countries 🤔,VALORANT
"Yup I know(as I only ever bought nightmarket skins) and im with you. Having gotten 2 vandal and 2 phantom skins, I made a conscious effort not to spend amy more money on the game until they adjust the pricing/introduce the community market/or allow us to sell the skins to buy other skins. 


But the thought process is still the same. 
If it cost them 20 bucks yo make a skin, and they can sell it for 17 bucks instead of 10. They will sell it for 17 bucks. Then, and only then, do they move it to night market, and since night market is what a week or two every 3 months, with a very limited choice, even whilst selling at lower price, they get your money as well as the money of people that werent going to buy it. 

Because the base price for the skin in ur head is 20 quid cause thats what they sold them for originally. So that 32% discount in nightmarket(where you need to get lucky to get the skin you want, and you only get 1 go every 3 months) subconsciously pressures you into buying it even more. 

It could be much worse. They could sell the skin at current prices, then once its gone, its gone forever, and nightmarket becomes a place where you get last chance to buy a skin at double the price.
Now I know people will say thats stupid, noone will do that, why would they charge more etc.

BUT

By doing that they create faux exclusivity(even more so than now), and there will always be people that will gladly drop 100+ for a single skin if its rare, exclusive enough. Like heres an example:

Lets say im a rich boi, that got into valorant at episode 6. I now want that sick music skin. 

I didnt buy it when it released cause I didnt even play the game. Now I get a chance to buy the phantom skin for a low low price of 50 bucks. Since I know the likelyhood of it dropping again in the night market is slim, I basically need to buy it now, or I might never get a chance to buy it again.

We see this in everyday life; older consoles, collectibles, etc. All selling for 2x,5x,10x the price it was worth on release, and people pay it. 


Gaming in 2023 is like real life; rich can afford to habe everything. The poor are lucky to even play it.",VALORANT
Any idea on how long?? iirc atleast 6m?? ri8?,VALORANT
I bought VP this Jan. Not sure if it's closed after that.,VALORANT
"read the comment above that. jesus christ it’s like some of you don’t know how to think properly lmao. the person i replied to, agreed that riot is an american company, and i was responding to them that that isn’t the case, and i just confirmed that riot *was* in fact, purchased by tencent in 2011. the fact that i have to break this down for you and explain it like you’re a child is pretty embarrassing tbh",VALORANT
"If they have offices in Ireland, they are more than likely for tax purposes.

All I’m saying is that ofc a post is gonna have low upvotes when it’s new 🤦‍♂️ it isn’t hard to understand mate,VALORANT

"The problem in Argentina is that you can't rely on the 'official' dollar-peso conversion from the government. Basically, that's the official rate but you can't change it anywhere, there's nowhere to buy dollars from, the amount you can buy is extremely little. When you buy dollars in the street, which is the only place you can realistically buy them, they are 490 pesos / 1 dollar now. It's basically governments corruption to steal even more from the people so they everything that is convenient for them they use the official rate, anything that is not is left to the 'blue' rate. Google 'argentina blue dollar valor' and you get the actual dollar value in Argentina.",VALORANT
What? Goverment has nothing to do in this situation... The problem here is that riot wants to match Us prices for people that doesn't have the same income. So at the end of the day you won't sell skins and you will get less profit. That's why steam created regional prices.,VALORANT
Really bro i don't any energy😪 to teach u bcuz u will not understand. So bro u r right and i am wrong now carry on with your work🙂,VALORANT
"Oh but your rply was like privileged one and my main point is they are increasing the already high prices. 
And srry i didn't know i could reach radiant i will try tomorrow",VALORANT
Ya i know rito will not change nd nobody care about us at corporate 😶. U know one of the major problem with rito in india is that we don't know when gov can ban valorant in india  bcuz of china🫢🤐🤐. Then what will happen to my money nd skins. This one of the major fear i have 😅(i am quite a overthinker),VALORANT
"Are You Saying Peoples in India(A 3rd World Country) are able Buy VP which are more Costly than in US(A 1st world Country)

€11.99($13.11) india for the same 1000VP Whereas in US is $9.99.

https://earlygame.com/valorant/valorant-points-price-all-regions",VALORANT
And i am saying if read my other comments that rito do not give shit about our region and they have not diverted any resources in this region to do any research on so called data u r saying. And i am not doing any random guess work  cause i have a small understanding of markets in india,VALORANT
if I have to look at the price of VP before buying it I have to accept i’m not a whale in rito’s eyes haha,VALORANT
"Mostly agree, but your last point doesn't really make sense in this context. Much like CSGO skins, classic consoles sell for that price because they'll stay (hopefully) at that price and will be valuable as you own them. There's also a limited number of them, giving that ""exclusivity"" you mentioned. Every Valorant skin, though, is exactly the same as the one that everyone else has. Your prime vandal would be identical to anyone else's, and it'll never have any value. I don't think anyone short of people who literally have no regard for their spending would even remotely consider double-priced skins.",VALORANT
I joined in Ch6Act2 and it was not available then,VALORANT
"it doesn't matter if they're a subsidiary of tencent, it's not a part of the conversation. riot HQ is in america and their work hours are american work hours. i hope you have a great day.",VALORANT
"Whilst many companies do that, RIOT has infrastructure here, whilst the decision to base their service center here is 100% down to tax breaks(as well as other reasons, like talent pool, english speakers etc.), they do operate in Ireland. 

This isn't the case of an address in Ireland, that doesn't even have a building.",VALORANT
"There is a difference between low upvotes and zero upvotes 🤦 Go to school and learn English mate

Edit : If you don't know what zero upvotes mean, then let me tell you that it means the post got down voted.",VALORANT
"Oh absolutely, but are we gonna boycott league because warwicks q sometimes does weird shit? Are we gonna boycott valorant because the shorty is insconsistent? Are we gonna boycott tft because ahri is good?",VALORANT
"I apologize if I was patronizing/insensitive, that wasn't my intention. I misunderstood your position a bit. Though very much not the same, as a Canadian I feel a small portion of your pain (PPP differences)",VALORANT
"Most likely just adjusting to USD conversion rates/taxes/vats and what not. They didn't increase prices on US, so core pricing is same.",VALORANT
Even more reason to not waste anything on gun skins and use it in the real world,VALORANT
They are mainly focusing on bigger regions like NA emea,VALORANT
Can you show me a source on riot not diverting any resources to do research in your region? Seems like a very strange them for them to publicly announce. (I don’t actually expect one. You're obviously completely talking out your ass.),VALORANT
Going to post one on riot technical support now,VALORANT
"yes but it’s literally ran by tencent. meaning that all the corporate decisions that riot makes, are finalized by tencent. has nothing to do with their HQ being located in the US. all executive decisions are happening in china",VALORANT
[deleted],VALORANT
"Yep, but sometimes (once in a blue moon) my logical reasoning is kicked in a corner by my emotions. 😔",VALORANT
 Yes i am talking out my ass bt i am not rito employe so i cannot  get inside information nd i think i can give evidence,VALORANT
"Dawg you really seem to not understand what corporate ownership is. Even if Tencent execs are making top level decisions (which they probably aren’t - more likely they just approve of the long term plans and aren’t generating any ideas themselves) Riot engineers work out of the US. So EVEN IF corporate decisions are being made in China (and that’s a big if), the folks keeping servers working are mostly US hours.",VALORANT
"The decision to release based on American work hours so the workers, who are almost if not all in America, can be available to fix any bugs right away was likely approved by Tencent.",VALORANT
"you are missing the point, rito is used  to laugh at how stupid rito is at times, not to actually boycott the company",VALORANT
if you don’t understand how corporations operate then please don’t make arbitrary claims,VALORANT
"He’s making the point that whoever decides when to push out the update in each region always decides to push it out in the US first, so that Riot engineers can work on patches and such ASAP.",VALORANT
"So, to be clear with what you just disagreed with, you think that updates rolling out to NA first doesn't have to do with the devs being based in America? Despite Riot themselves stating this?",VALORANT
